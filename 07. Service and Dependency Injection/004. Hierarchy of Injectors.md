In Angular, Dependency Injection (DI) is a mechanism that enables different components, services, and directives to request dependencies from Angular rather than creating them directly. Angular injectors work in a layered structure.

### Key Concepts of Angular Dependency Injection

1. **Injectors**: Injectors in Angular are responsible for managing the dependencies (services, for example) that components, directives, or other services need. Angular has different injectors in a hierarchical structure:
   - **Platform EnvironmentInjector**: The top-level injector that can provide shared services across multiple applications in a single Angular project.
   - **Application Root EnvironmentInjector**: The main injector for the application, responsible for providing single-instance services available throughout the app.
   - **ModuleInjector**: Available if the application uses NgModules, allowing you to register providers at the module level. This helps to scope services to specific feature modules if desired.
   - **ElementInjector**: Each component has its own injector (ElementInjector), which Angular uses first to check if the component's required service instance is provided locally.

2. **Dependency Resolution Process**: 
   - When a component, directive, or service requests a dependency, Angular starts at the **ElementInjector** level.
   - If the dependency isn't found at the ElementInjector level, Angular moves up the hierarchy to the **ModuleInjector** or **Application Root EnvironmentInjector**.
   - If the service still isn't found, Angular checks the **Platform EnvironmentInjector**.
   - If none of these injectors provide the requested dependency, the **NullInjector** is reached, which triggers an error, indicating the dependency was not found.

3. **@Injectable Decorator**: To make a class injectable, Angular requires it to be decorated with `@Injectable()`. By setting `providedIn: 'root'`, you register it with the Application Root EnvironmentInjector, making it available application-wide without additional configuration.

4. **Error Handling (NullInjector)**: If a service is requested but not provided by any injector, the **NullInjector** returns an error. This typically indicates a missing provider, often because the service lacks the `@Injectable` decorator or isn't registered in any module or provider.

### Example of Using `@Injectable` with Dependency Injection

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root', // Register with Application Root EnvironmentInjector
})
export class TasksService {
  // Logic and data for managing tasks
}
```

With this setup, Angular automatically provides a single instance of `TasksService` at the root level, making it available to all components without manual instantiation.

### Summary

- **Dependency Injection** allows you to request dependencies instead of creating them.
- **Hierarchy of Injectors** lets Angular handle dependencies efficiently, checking each level for requested services.
- **@Injectable** with `providedIn: 'root'` registers a service globally at the root level.
- If a dependency isn't found, **NullInjector** raises an error, helping developers identify missing providers.

This DI system allows Angular to manage dependencies in a highly organized and optimized way, especially beneficial for large applications with shared services.
