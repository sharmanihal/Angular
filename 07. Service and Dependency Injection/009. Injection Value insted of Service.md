To inject a value instead of an Service we can do :

1. Make use of the providers array of the @Component decorator.
   This providers array takes
   ```
   providers:[
     {
        provide: <Injection Token>,
       useValue: <Value that you want to inject>
     }
   ]
   ```

2. In this case say you want to provide an array. You can create an Injection token and useValue like this:

3. Now go in the compoenent where you want to provide this value:

4. Now you can use this value anywhere in the component and the sub component.
