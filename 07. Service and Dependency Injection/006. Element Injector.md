You've provided an informative overview of using the **element injector** in Angular, particularly in the context of providing services at the component level. Hereâ€™s a condensed summary of your explanation along with some important points to consider:

Note : You can remove the @Injectable if you are using element injector.

### Using the Element Injector in Angular

1. **Element Injector Overview**:
   - The **element injector** is closely tied to DOM elements and is part of Angular's injector tree. It's used for providing services that are scoped to specific components and their child components.
   - This injector is distinct from the **root environment injector**, which makes services available globally across the application.

2. **Providing Services with Element Injector**:
   - To use the element injector, you can provide a service (like `TasksService`) directly in a component's `@Component` decorator using the `providers` array.
   - This configuration allows all child components (and directives) within the component's template to access the same instance of the provided service.
   - For example, if you add `TasksService` to the `providers` array of the `TasksComponent`, both the `NewTaskComponent` and `TasksListComponent` can share the same instance of `TasksService`.

3. **Scope of the Service**:
   - The service provided via the element injector is limited to the component tree rooted at that specific component. Other components, such as the `AppComponent`, will not have access to this service unless it is provided at a higher level in the component hierarchy.
   - This encapsulation can be useful for managing state or functionality specific to a particular feature without affecting the global state of the application.

4. **Instance Management**:
   - When a service is provided in a component's `providers` array, each instance of that component will have its own separate instance of the service.
   - If you provide `TasksService` inside the `TasksListComponent`, it will get a different instance than `NewTaskComponent`, which might lead to inconsistencies if they need to share state.

5. **Use Cases**:
   - Use the element injector when you want to encapsulate a service's functionality within a specific component or feature, ensuring that only its child components can access it.
   - This approach can be useful for managing local state, handling service configurations, or limiting the impact of service changes to a specific part of your application.

6. **Considerations**:
   - While using the element injector, be mindful of how the instances of services are managed and whether sharing instances across components is necessary for your use case.
   - Understanding the scope of the element injector versus the Application root injector is crucial for effective service management in Angular applications.

### Conclusion

The element injector provides a powerful way to manage service instances within specific components, offering fine-grained control over service availability and instance management. If you have any further questions or need clarification on any specific points, feel free to ask!
