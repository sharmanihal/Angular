### Injecting Services into Other Services in Angular

1. **Creating a Logging Service**:
   - You can create a logging service using the Angular CLI. Run:
     ```bash
     ng g service logging --skip-tests
     ```
   - This command generates a new `logging.service.ts` file with an `@Injectable` decorator.

2. **Implementing the Log Method**:
   - In the `LoggingService`, add a `log` method that accepts a string message. This method will generate a timestamp and log the message to the console:
     ```typescript
     log(message: string) {
         const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
         console.log(`[${timestamp}] ${message}`);
     }
     ```
   - This service can later be expanded to send logs to a backend if needed.

3. **Injecting the Logging Service**:
   - To use the `LoggingService` in another service (like `TasksService`), simply inject it via the constructor:
     ```typescript
     constructor(private loggingService: LoggingService) {}
     ```
   - You can then call the `log` method to log messages, for example:
     ```typescript
     this.loggingService.log(`Added task with title: ${taskData.title}`);
     ```

4. **Potential Issues with Element Injector**:
   - If you try to provide the `LoggingService` using the **element injector** (e.g., in a component’s `providers` array), you’ll encounter a `NullInjectorError` when trying to inject it into another service.
   - This happens because services do not have access to the element injector; they can only access the environment injector or module injector.

5. **Correct Service Provisioning**:
   - To avoid issues, you should either:
     - Provide the service in the `main.ts` file using the `providers` array when calling `bootstrapApplication`.
     - or
     - Use `providedIn: 'root'` in the service’s `@Injectable` decorator, making it accessible throughout the application.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Once the `LoggingService` is properly provided, you can easily inject it into other services without any problems. This is a common practice in Angular applications, enabling better organization and functionality.
