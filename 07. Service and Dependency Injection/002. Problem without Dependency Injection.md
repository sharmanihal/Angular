In Angular, to share data and logic across multiple components with services, we need a **single, shared instance** of the service. Here’s a breakdown of how we can achieve this:

### Why Not Use Manual Instantiation?

Initially, you might think to create an instance of `TasksService` directly within the `NewTaskComponent` by adding something like this in the component’s constructor:

```typescript
constructor() {
  this.tasksService = new TasksService();
}
```

However, if we do this:
- Each component using `TasksService` would create its own instance.
- Separate instances wouldn’t share data, so tasks added in `NewTaskComponent` would not be accessible in `TasksListComponent`.

This defeats the purpose of a centralized service, as components would hold independent, isolated instances rather than a shared one.

### Solution: Dependency Injection with Angular

Angular’s **dependency injection** (DI) solves this by managing a single instance of the service. When you configure a service as a provider at the appropriate level, Angular injects the same instance of the service wherever it is requested, making it a truly shared resource.
