* Performance Considerations:

    Using @Injectable with providedIn: 'root' is generally preferred because it can help create smaller and more efficient code bundles through tree shaking.
    The alternative method should be used with caution, especially if you're dealing with services that are not immediately necessary at the application startup.

* Lazy Loading and Code Splitting:

    In larger applications, consider implementing lazy loading to defer loading certain modules and services until they are needed. This can greatly improve the efficiency of your application and reduce the initial load time.
