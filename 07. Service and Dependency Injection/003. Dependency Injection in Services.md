In Angular, **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a built-in feature that allows components, directives, and services to request dependencies they need, which Angular then provides. Instead of creating instances of services and other dependencies manually, Angular takes care of instantiating them, managing their lifecycle, and injecting them where needed. This makes code cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain.

Here’s a summary and example to illustrate how Angular’s DI works:

### Summary of Dependency Injection in Angular

- **Purpose**: Angular’s DI system allows classes (like components or services) to declare dependencies they need, and Angular provides them automatically.
- **Injectors**: Angular manages multiple "injectors" which store instances of services and other dependencies. When a component, directive, or service requests a dependency, Angular searches through these injectors to provide it.
- **Service Injection**: DI is often used for services, allowing multiple components to share the same instance without creating duplicates. This is particularly useful for managing shared data or logic.


In Angular, there are two primary ways to perform Dependency Injection (DI): using the **constructor** and using the **`inject()` function**. Here’s how each one works:

### 1. Constructor Injection (Traditional Syntax)

The constructor syntax is the most commonly used method for DI in Angular. You specify the dependency in the constructor parameters, and Angular injects the dependency when the class is instantiated.

#### Example:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { TasksService } from './tasks.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-new-task',
  template: `<button (click)="addNewTask()">Add Task</button>`,
})
export class NewTaskComponent {
  constructor(private tasksService: TasksService) {} // Angular injects the instance

  addNewTask() {
    this.tasksService.addTask('New Task'); // Use service to add a task
  }
}
```

Here, Angular injects `TasksService` into the `NewTaskComponent` via the constructor parameter. This approach is straightforward and automatically creates a class property.

### 2. `inject()` Function (Alternative Syntax)

The `inject()` function is an alternative way to inject dependencies, especially useful when you don’t want to declare dependencies in the constructor. This function can be called within the body of a class and is useful in functional providers, standalone components, or when you want to inject dependencies outside the constructor context.

To use `inject()`, import it from Angular's core module.

#### Example:

```typescript
import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { TasksService } from './tasks.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-new-task',
  template: `<button (click)="addNewTask()">Add Task</button>`,
})
export class NewTaskComponent {
  private tasksService = inject(TasksService); // Dependency injected directly

  addNewTask() {
    this.tasksService.addTask('New Task'); // Use service to add a task
  }
}
```

In this case:
- `inject(TasksService)` directly injects `TasksService` into a class property without the constructor.
- This approach can make testing easier and keeps dependencies clean, especially in more complex classes or standalone services.
