### Understanding Dependency Injection in Angular

In Angular, you can register services using the `@Injectable` decorator, but it’s important to understand what happens behind the scenes when you register a service. Let’s explore this further:

#### 1. **Default Service Registration**:
   - When you use the `@Injectable` decorator, Angular automatically creates a provider object that registers your service.
   - This provider object includes a **provide** property (the injection token) and one of the **use** properties (like `useClass`, `useExisting`, `useFactory`, or `useValue`).

#### 2. **Injection Tokens**:
   - The injection token acts as an identifier for the injectable service. By default, it uses the service class name.
   - You can create a custom injection token using `InjectionToken` from `@angular/core`:
     ```typescript
     import { InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';

     export const TASKS_SERVICE_TOKEN = new InjectionToken<TasksService>('TasksService');
     ```

#### 3. **Providing a Service with a Custom Token**:
   - In the `main.ts` file, you can provide the service with the custom token like this:
     ```typescript
     providers: [
         { provide: TASKS_SERVICE_TOKEN, useClass: TasksService }
     ]
     ```
   - With this setup, you'll need to use the custom token whenever you want to inject the service.

#### 4. **Using the Custom Token in Components**:
   - In your components, import the custom token and use it for injection. For example, in a component constructor:
     ```typescript
     constructor(@Inject(TASKS_SERVICE_TOKEN) private tasksService: TasksService) {}
     ```
   - The `@Inject` decorator is necessary here to specify that you're using a custom token for injection.

#### 5. **Type Information**:
   - Since the injection token is generic, you can provide type information to TypeScript when creating the token:
     ```typescript
     export const TASKS_SERVICE_TOKEN = new InjectionToken<TasksService>('TasksService');
     ```

#### 6. **Error Handling**:
   - If you forget to use the custom token, Angular will throw a `NullInjectorError`, indicating that the dependency wasn't found.

#### 7. **Conclusion**:
   - While using the `@Injectable` decorator is straightforward and recommended for most cases, understanding how to create and use custom injection tokens allows for greater flexibility in more complex applications.
