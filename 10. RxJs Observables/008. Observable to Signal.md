Here's a summary of the key points regarding converting observables to signals in Angular, along with an explanation of their behaviors:

### Converting Observables to Signals

1. **Creating an Observable**: 
   - You can create an observable using RxJS, such as with the `interval` function.
   - For example: `interval$ = interval(1000);`

2. **Subscribing**: 
   - Unlike signals, observables do not emit values until you subscribe to them.

3. **Converting to Signal**: 
   - To convert an observable to a signal, use the `toSignal` function from `@angular/core/rxjs-interop`.
   - This can be done during property setup or in the constructor.
   - Example: 
     ```javascript
     intervalSignal = toSignal(interval$);
     ```

4. **Initial Value**:
   - Observables created from functions like `interval` do not have an initial value, so the signal created from them will initially be `undefined`.
   - To set a custom initial value when converting an observable to a signal, you can pass a second argument to `toSignal`:
     ```javascript
     intervalSignal = toSignal(interval$, { initialValue: 0 });
     ```
   - This allows the signal to have a predefined starting point (e.g., zero).

5. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - When a signal is created from an observable using `toSignal`, Angular automatically cleans up the subscription when the component is destroyed.
   - You can disable this automatic cleanup by setting `manualCleanup: true`, but it's typically unnecessary.

6. **Using the Signal**:
   - Once you have a signal from an observable, you can use it like any other signal, including displaying it in templates or using it in `computed` or `effect` functions.

### Key Differences

- **Initial Values**:
  - **Signals**: Always have an initial value (can be set explicitly).
  - **Observables**: Do not have an initial value unless specified when creating a subject.

- **Lifecycle Management**:
  - Signals created from observables handle their own cleanup automatically when components are destroyed.

### Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s an example code snippet that summarizes the concepts:

```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { interval, toSignal } from 'rxjs';
import { signal } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `<div>Interval Count: {{ intervalSignal() }}</div>`,
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  // Create an observable that emits every second
  interval$ = interval(1000);

  // Convert the observable to a signal with an initial value of 0
  intervalSignal = toSignal(this.interval$, { initialValue: 0 });

  constructor() {
    // The signal can now be used in the template
  }
}
```

### Summary
This concise guide outlines how to convert observables to signals in Angular, highlighting the differences in initial values, automatic cleanup, and the manner in which they are used. This approach allows for efficient state management and reactive programming within Angular applications.
