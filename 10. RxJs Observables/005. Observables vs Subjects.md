Here's a quick summary for **Observables** vs. **Subjects**:

---

### Observables
- **Independent Streams**: Each subscription to an observable creates a new, separate stream of data.
- **Example**: With `interval`, each subscriber starts counting from zero, independent of when they subscribed.
- **Automatic Emissions**: Observables produce values automatically, like a timer in `interval`, without external control over emissions.
- **Single Stream**: Observables don’t share their streams with multiple subscribers in real-time; each subscriber experiences the observable’s emissions as a fresh instance.

### Subjects
- **Shared Stream**: All subscribers to a subject share the same stream. They receive the same data at the same time once they subscribe.
- **Control Over Emissions**: Subjects allow you to control what values are sent and when, making them like a custom event emitter.
- **Real-Time Updates**: New subscribers see only the values emitted after they subscribe; they don’t receive any past values.
- **Useful for Multiple Listeners**: Ideal when you want multiple parts of an app to listen to the same data without each starting from scratch.

This should give you a good foundation for understanding when and why to use each!
