In RxJS, an observable represents a stream of data that you can listen to, and it uses three main methods—`next`, `complete`, and `error`—to handle different stages of that data stream.

1. **`next(value)`**: The `next` method is triggered each time the observable emits a new value. It’s where you define what to do with each emitted value, such as logging it or updating the UI.

2. **`complete()`**: The `complete` method is called when the observable finishes sending values and won’t emit any more data. This might happen when an observable completes a specific task or reaches the end of its stream. However, not all observables complete (e.g., `interval` emits values indefinitely until manually unsubscribed).

3. **`error(err)`**: The `error` method is triggered if an error occurs during data emission, such as a failed HTTP request. It provides a way to handle errors gracefully, allowing you to display an error message or try a fallback action.

For an observable to start emitting values, it needs at least one active **subscriber**. This means that until you subscribe to the observable, it doesn’t begin generating or pushing out data, as RxJS optimizes by only producing data when someone is actively listening to it. This is why the `subscribe()` function is essential—it activates the observable, which then begins emitting values according to its configuration.
