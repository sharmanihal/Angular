In Angular's **template-driven form** approach, Angular provides a simple and declarative way to manage forms directly within the HTML template. Here, we’ll learn how to register form controls, access form data, and validate input using template-driven forms. This approach allows Angular to handle forms with minimal setup in the component class.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we've done to manage a form with template-driven forms:

### Step 1: Set Up the Template and Register Inputs

To start, we add the `ngModel` directive to our form’s input fields. This registers each input with Angular and allows Angular to track and manage them automatically.

#### Explanation
- We add `ngModel` to each input, which registers them with Angular's form system.
- `name` attributes (like `"email"` and `"password"`) are required for `ngModel` to work. Angular uses these `name` values to identify the form controls.
- The `#form="ngForm"` syntax assigns the Angular form instance to the `form` template variable, giving us access to Angular's managed form object.
- The `(ngSubmit)="onSubmit(form)"` event binding triggers the `onSubmit` method in the component class when the form is submitted, passing the `form` variable.
