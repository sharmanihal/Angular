### Step 1: Angular’s CSS Classes for Validation
Angular automatically adds certain CSS classes to form controls based on their state, which you can use to visually indicate invalid inputs.

1. **Common CSS Classes**:
   - `ng-pristine`: Indicates the field has not been modified by the user.
   - `ng-dirty`: Indicates the field has been modified.
   - `ng-touched`: Indicates the user has clicked in and out of the field.
   - `ng-untouched`: Indicates the field hasn’t been interacted with.
   - `ng-valid`: Field is valid according to Angular’s validation rules.
   - `ng-invalid`: Field is invalid according to Angular’s validation rules.

### Step 2: Adding Styles to Highlight Invalid Fields
Use these classes in your CSS to style the input fields based on their validation status. Here’s an example of how you could apply these styles in your CSS:

```css
input.ng-invalid.ng-touched {
  border: 2px solid red;
}

input.ng-valid.ng-touched {
  border: 2px solid green;
}

.control-error {
  color: red;
  font-size: 0.9em;
  margin-top: 5px;
}
```

These styles will:
- Highlight invalid fields in red after they’ve been touched.
- Highlight valid fields in green once they meet the requirements.

### Step 3: Displaying Control-Specific Error Messages
To provide specific error messages under each input field, use conditions that check whether each field is touched, dirty, and invalid.

Here’s how you can add specific error messages for email and password fields in your template:
