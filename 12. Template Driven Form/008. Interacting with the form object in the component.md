#### Step 1: Resetting the Form on Submission

To reset the form after submission, we will use the `reset` method on the `NgForm` object. This method clears the input values and resets all internal state information (like validation status).

1. **Modify the `onSubmit` Method**:

3. **Test the Functionality**:
   After entering valid values and clicking the submit button, verify that the inputs are cleared, and the form state is reset to **pristine and untouched.**

   
#### Step 2: Saving User Input to Local Storage

Next, we want to save the email input as the user types. This will allow us to pre-populate the form on page reload. Angular form provides us a valueChange observable, to which we can subscribe to and ,it's next value wii get triggred everytime there is a value change in one of the input controls of the form.
The next provides us with an object which will have all input objects and their current value.

1. **Access the Form Object with `ViewChild`**:

The debounceTime(500) in code is used to improve performance by limiting how often the code inside next is triggered while the user is typing. Specifically:
- Without debounceTime(500): Every keystroke would trigger the next function, saving the email to local storage on each character typed. This can be inefficient, especially if the user is typing quickly.
- With debounceTime(500): The next function only triggers if there’s a pause of 500 milliseconds between keystrokes. This means:
    * If the user keeps typing, next doesn’t run, which reduces unnecessary operations.
    * If the user stops typing for at least 500 milliseconds, the latest value is saved to local storage.


3. **Verify Local Storage Updates**:
   Check the Application tab in your browser’s developer tools. You should see the `saved-login-form` key being updated with the email value every time you type in the email field.

#### Step 3: Pre-Populating the Form with Saved Data

To repopulate the form with the saved email value when the component loads, we will read from local storage.

1. **Load the Saved Email in `ngOnInit`**:

**Why do we need the setTimeout() ?**

In Angular, `afterNextRender` indeed runs after the first change detection cycle, but there’s a subtle detail here: it doesn’t guarantee that all child components and directives are fully initialized, particularly when it comes to controls within a form. The form itself might be initialized, but its controls (like individual inputs) may still be going through final stages of setup, which can cause `setValue` to throw an error if it tries to access uninitialized properties.

Using `setTimeout` with a minimal delay allows Angular to fully initialize all controls in the next "tick" (or update cycle) before attempting to set the values. This workaround is mainly needed in template-driven forms, where form controls are primarily defined in the template, and Angular’s lifecycle hooks are not always fully synchronized with the template-driven control setup.
