To manage a form using **template-driven forms** in Angular, you take these main steps:

1. **Add the `ngModel` Directive**: Start by adding the `ngModel` directive to the form's input elements in the HTML template. The `ngModel` directive makes Angular aware of each input field, allowing Angular to manage and validate these fields. For example:
   
   ```html
   <input type="email" name="email" ngModel>
   <input type="password" name="password" ngModel>
   ```

2. **Set Up `FormsModule`**: In order to use `ngModel`, you need to import `FormsModule` in your component module (e.g., `login.module.ts`). Without `FormsModule`, Angular won't recognize `ngModel`, and it will throw an error.

   ```typescript
   import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

   @NgModule({
     imports: [FormsModule],
     // other settings
   })
   ```

3. **Use `name` Attribute**: When using `ngModel`, every input field must have a `name` attribute. Angular uses this `name` to identify the control, so the field can be registered and managed correctly. In this example, weâ€™ve set `name="email"` for the email input and `name="password"` for the password input.

If you use ngModel without the [(...)] syntax, it acts as a one-way binding that only registers the input with Angular's forms system.

- **Template-driven forms** rely on HTML templates and directives like `ngModel`.
- **FormsModule** is essential to enable template-driven forms in Angular.
- **Validation** can be done directly in the template using built-in validators (like `required`).
- **Error messages** and **state management** can be controlled based on the Angular form control states like `invalid` and `touched`. 

This approach is great for straightforward forms, providing a clear way to handle form data and validation directly in the template without needing too much JavaScript logic.
