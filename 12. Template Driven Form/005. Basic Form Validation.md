Handling form validation in Angular using the **template-driven approach** involves leveraging Angular's built-in directives to validate input fields. Below is a detailed explanation of how to implement validation, check form status, and handle submissions based on the form's validity.

### Step 1: Adding Validation Directives

When using template-driven forms, you can add validation directives directly to your input fields. Here are some common directives:

- **required**: Ensures that the field cannot be empty.
- **email**: Validates that the input conforms to email format.
- **minlength**: Specifies the minimum length for the input.

### Step 2: Submitting the Form

When the form is submitted, you can check the validity of the form using the `valid` and `invalid` properties. This allows you to prevent any further actions if the form is invalid.

### Step 3: Understanding Form Object Changes

When you add validation directives, Angular updates the form object it manages. You can observe changes in the form status when validation rules are applied. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- If the form is empty and submitted, the form object will reflect `invalid` as `true` and show that the required validation failed.
- If an invalid email is entered, the form status remains `invalid`, but the error information will show that the email validation failed.


### Summary

1. **Validation Directives**: Use Angular validation directives like `required`, `email`, and `minlength` in your template to enforce rules.
2. **Form Submission Handling**: Check `formData.invalid` before processing the form to prevent submissions with invalid data.
3. **Error Messages**: Display user-friendly error messages in the template based on validation states.
4. **Accessing Form Object**: Log the form object to see its current state and validation status.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage form validation in Angular's template-driven forms, providing a seamless user experience while ensuring data integrity.
