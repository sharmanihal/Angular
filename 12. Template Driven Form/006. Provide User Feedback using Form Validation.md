We can add template varibales on the input we want to check for validation:

- Template Variable Syntax: Use the syntax #variableName="ngModel" to create template variables that reference the control objects managed by Angular.

The form input template varibale when used like #variableName="ngModel" , will give reference to the control obejct managed  by angular and this refrence then has some 
properties like touched, that can help in validations.
