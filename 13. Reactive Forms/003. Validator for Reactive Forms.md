In this section, you're learning how to implement validation for inputs in Angular's reactive forms approach. Here's a summary of the key points along with the relevant code snippets:

### Key Points:
1. **Setting Up Validators:**
   - Unlike the template-driven approach, where validators are added directly in the template, in reactive forms, validators are set up in the TypeScript code during the creation of form controls.

2. **Adding Validators:**
   - You can add validators when initializing form controls by passing an array of validators or a configuration object. Using a configuration object can make the code more readable.

3. **Using Built-in Validators:**
   - Angular provides built-in validators such as `Validators.required` and `Validators.email` for common validation needs. You can import these validators from `@angular/forms`.

4. **Checking Validation Status:**
   - You can check the validity status of form controls and display error messages based on their state. Itâ€™s common to create getter methods to simplify the checks for whether a control is invalid.

### Summary:
- The above code demonstrates how to set up validation for form controls using Angular's reactive forms approach. Validators are added directly in the component code, allowing for better type safety and control over validation logic. The HTML template includes conditional error messages that display based on the validity of the input fields, improving user experience by providing immediate feedback.
