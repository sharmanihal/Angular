### Key Points:
1. **Creating a Custom Validator:**
   - A custom validator in reactive forms is simply a function that takes an `AbstractControl` as an input and returns `null` if valid or an object describing the error if invalid.

2. **Validator Function Structure:**
   - The function should check the control’s value for specific criteria (in this case, whether it includes a question mark).

3. **Registering the Custom Validator:**
   - The custom validator is added to the form control’s validators array when initializing the control.

4. **Error Message Handling:**
   - You can customize error messages based on the validation requirements, enhancing user feedback.


Note : We can also put these validator functions in a seprate ts file , and export them, to maintain sepration of concerns.
