## Async Validators

Setting up asynchronous validators in Angular is a powerful way to validate user input, especially when you need to check values against backend data, such as checking if an email is already registered. Let’s summarize the process for creating and using asynchronous validators with some code examples.

### Steps to Create and Use an Async Validator in Angular

1. **Define the Async Validator Function**: The async validator function should return an observable. If the value is valid, it should emit `null`; if invalid, it should emit an error observable object.

2. **Register the Async Validator**: Use the async validator in your form controls when defining the form group.

Here’s how you can implement an async validator to check for unique email addresses:

### Explanation

1. **Async Validator Function**:
   - The `emailIsUnique` function checks if the provided email is `test@example.com`.
   - It simulates an asynchronous check by returning an observable that emits either `null` (valid) or an error object `{ notUnique: true }` (invalid) after a short delay (using `delay`).

2. **Registering the Validator**:
   - In the `FormGroup` definition, the async validator is added to the `email` control using `asyncValidators`. 
   
3. **Using the Validator**:
   - When the form is used, if the user inputs `test@example.com`, the validator will return an error, marking the email as invalid. Any other email will pass validation.

### Benefits of Async Validators
- **Network Requests**: You can perform complex checks against backend services, such as verifying user uniqueness, checking for existing usernames, etc.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works seamlessly with Angular's reactive forms and can provide feedback to the user asynchronously.
- **Error Handling**: You can define clear error messages based on the validation result, enhancing user experience.
