In this section, you're learning how to handle form submissions using Angular's reactive forms approach. Here's a summary of the key points along with the relevant code snippets:

### Key Points:
1. **Form Submission with `ngSubmit`:**
   - To handle form submission, use the `ngSubmit` event in the template, which does not require passing any arguments to the submission method because you already have access to the form in your component class.

2. **Accessing Form Values:**
   - Once the form is submitted, you can easily access the form's value, status, and controls in a type-safe manner due to TypeScript support with reactive forms.
