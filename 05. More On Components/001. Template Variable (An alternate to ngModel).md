Using template variables with Angular provides a flexible way to access form elements directly, and it is indeed an alternative to two-way binding (ngModel).
Why Use Template Variables for Accessing Input Values?

    Template Variable Creation:
        A template variable is created using a # (hashtag) followed by the variable name (e.g., #titleInput).
        This variable holds a reference to the HTML element (like <input> or <textarea>) it’s attached to.

    Accessing Element Values:
        When you pass the template variable to a method (e.g., onSubmit), Angular gives you access to the underlying DOM object.
        The method can then use this reference to access properties of the input, such as value.

    Direct Access to DOM Properties:
        With template variables, you get access to the full DOM object, which includes properties like value, checked for checkboxes, and other native element attributes.
        For example, if titleInput is an <input>, in your method, you can access the value with titleInput.value.

Example: Using Template Variable in Angular

Here’s a simplified version of the code flow:

Template:

<input #titleInput type="text" />
<button (click)="onSubmit(titleInput)">Submit</button>

Component:

onSubmit(titleElement: HTMLInputElement) {
  const enteredTitle = titleElement.value;
  console.log(enteredTitle);
}

How This Works:

    Template Variable #titleInput: Stores a reference to the input element.
    Passing to onSubmit: When the button is clicked, the input element is passed to the onSubmit method.
    Accessing value: Inside onSubmit, titleElement is of type HTMLInputElement, which gives direct access to titleElement.value to retrieve the text entered by the user.

Advantages of Using Template Variables:

    Less Overhead: Unlike two-way binding (ngModel), template variables don’t track changes on every keystroke, which can be more efficient for certain use cases.
    Direct Access to Element: Allows for precise control over the DOM element, making it suitable for more complex interactions with form elements.
    Simpler Setup: For cases where you only need the value when the user triggers an action (like clicking a button), template variables can be simpler than setting up a model and binding.

When to Use This Approach:

    Simple Forms: For small forms where you only need the values when an action occurs (like a button click).
    Performance Considerations: When you want to avoid continuous model updates with ngModel as the user types.
    Direct DOM Manipulation: When you need access to other properties of the input, like checking if it’s focused or manipulating classes directly.

Summary:
This method of using template variables provides a clean and efficient way to interact with user input in Angular without relying on ngModel. While it’s not necessarily better or worse than two-way binding, it’s an important approach to understand, as it gives you flexibility depending on your specific requirements.
