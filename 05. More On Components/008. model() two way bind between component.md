In Angular 17.2 and later, a simpler approach to set up two-way binding is available using the new `model` function. Here’s how it works:

### Steps to Set Up Two-Way Binding with `model`

1. **Import and Use the `model` Function**:
   First, you import `model` from `@angular/core` and then assign it to the two-way bindable property in your component. The `model` function will make the property two-way bindable, so you don’t need separate `@Input()` and `@Output()` decorators.

   ```typescript
   import { Component, model } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-rect',
     template: `
       <div [style.width]="size().width" [style.height]="size().height" (click)="onReset()"></div>
     `
   })
   export class RectComponent {
     size = model.required<{ width: string; height: string }>(); // Two-way bindable property
     
     onReset() {
       this.size.set({ width: '200px', height: '100px' }); // Updating size with set method
     }
   }
   ```

   - The `model` function is used to define the `size` property as a two-way bindable property.
   - Using `.required` on the model makes sure a value is always passed (optional but helpful for validation).

2. **Using `size` as a Signal**:
   Since `size` is now a ModelSignal, you call it as a function (`size()`) in the template, which will trigger Angular’s automatic reactivity. Angular will listen for any changes to `size` and re-render the component as needed.

3. **Updating the Signal**:
   Instead of emitting an event, you use `set` to update the ModelSignal directly. This change will automatically reflect in the parent component:

   ```typescript
   onReset() {
     this.size.set({ width: '200px', height: '100px' });
   }
   ```

4. **Parent Component Binding**:
   In the parent component template (e.g., `AppComponent`), use two-way binding syntax `[(size)]` to bind the property.

   ```html
   <app-rect [(size)]="rectSize"></app-rect>
   ```

   - This syntax binds the `size` property of the `RectComponent` to a `rectSize` property in the parent, maintaining synchronization between the two.

### Benefits
With the `model` function, Angular handles both input and output under the hood, reducing the amount of code and simplifying two-way binding for properties. This method is flexible and works with Signals or non-Signal values in the parent component. 

### Summary
Using `model`, you set up a two-way binding without needing separate input and output decorators. This modern syntax in Angular 17.2 makes your code cleaner and automatically leverages Angular’s reactivity with minimal setup.
