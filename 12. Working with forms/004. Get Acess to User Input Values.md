In this example, we're using **template-driven forms** to access form data and perform validation using Angular's automatically managed form object. Letâ€™s break down how to extract form values and add validation, so we can ensure only valid data is submitted.

### Step 1: Access Form Values on Submission

To extract values from the form, we access Angular's `ngForm` object, which provides details about each form control (like `email` and `password`) and their current values. Instead of using two-way binding, we retrieve values from the form object only when the form is submitted.

#### Explanation:
- **Parameter Rename**: We rename `form` to `formData` to avoid conflicts (e.g., `form.form`).
- **Accessing Values**: Using `formData.form.value.email` and `formData.form.value.password` to access input values only upon form submission.

This approach is helpful if you only need form values at submission, making it more efficient for simpler forms than two-way binding.

### Summary

1. **Form Setup**: Add `ngModel` and `name` to inputs for Angular tracking.
2. **Access Values**: Extract values from the form object upon submission without two-way binding.


By using template-driven forms with Angular, you gain robust form control, error tracking, and validation with minimal setup, all directly managed in the HTML template.
