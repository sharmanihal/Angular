Angular’s change detection mechanism is all about keeping the UI in sync with the application state, and it relies on **Zone.js** to watch for any events or changes that might need to be reflected on the screen.

### How Default Change Detection Works in Angular

1. **Zone.js and the “Zone” Wrapper**:
   - Angular wraps the entire component tree in a *zone*, which monitors potential events like clicks, HTTP requests, or timers.
   - When an event occurs, Zone.js notifies Angular, triggering the change detection cycle.

2. **Component Tree Evaluation**:
   - Angular doesn’t just check the component where the event occurred; it **checks all components** across the app.
   - During this process, Angular visits every component’s template, looking at **template bindings** (like property bindings and string interpolations) to see if they produce new values.

3. **Updating the DOM**:
   - If Angular finds a change in a template binding (meaning the new value differs from the previous one), it updates the DOM with the new value.
   
4. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - For demonstration, if you log the value of a property binding in each component using a `debugOutput` getter, Angular will log the message every time change detection checks that binding.
   - You’ll notice that **even components unrelated to the event (like a button click)** are checked. This is Angular’s default behavior to ensure everything stays up to date.

### Why Are Components Checked Twice?

   - You might see that each component's bindings are checked twice when an event happens. This double-checking is intentional:
      - **First Check**: Angular performs an initial check after the event to catch any changes.
      - **Second Check**: Angular then runs a second check to verify that no additional changes were triggered by the first check (this is known as the “**stability check**”).
      - If everything is consistent between these two checks, Angular assumes the app is stable. If not, Angular will throw an error (often related to “expression has changed after it was checked”).

### Performance Tips for Change Detection

- **Avoid Heavy Getters**: Since Angular re-evaluates getters in templates frequently, avoid using complex calculations or time-intensive operations inside them.
- **Optimize with Change Detection Strategies**: Angular has ways to control when and how change detection happens, such as the `OnPush` change detection strategy, which we can explore if you'd like!

This default change detection mechanism might seem intensive, but Angular’s architecture is optimized for it. By understanding these processes, you can fine-tune your app to avoid unnecessary checks and improve performance.
