The `OnPush` change detection strategy in Angular is a powerful way to optimize your app's performance by reducing the frequency of change detection checks for certain components. By setting `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` on a component, Angular limits change detection to specific conditions, rather than running it on every change in the application. Here’s a closer look at how `OnPush` works and when to use it.

### 1. How `OnPush` Works
With `OnPush`, Angular only re-evaluates the component in the following cases:
   - **Input Property Changes**: If an `@Input` property of the component receives a new value.
   - **Event Binding (like `click`)**: If a bound event on the component triggers a change.
   - **Observable Emits New Value**: If the component subscribes to an observable (like a subject) and it emits a new value.
   - **Manual Change Detection Triggering**: Using `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()` or `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` can force change detection manually if necessary.

In contrast to the default change detection strategy, which checks every component in the tree whenever any change occurs, `OnPush` allows Angular to skip over components if these specific conditions aren't met. This can prevent unnecessary change detection cycles, reducing the performance load.

### 2. Enabling `OnPush`
To enable `OnPush`, set the `changeDetection` property in the component’s decorator:

```typescript
import { Component, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-messages',
  template: `...`,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class MessagesComponent { ... }
```

### 3. Benefits of Using `OnPush`
   - **Improved Performance**: Fewer change detection cycles mean that Angular skips parts of the component tree, reducing CPU and memory usage.
   - **Efficient for Immutable Patterns**: Since `OnPush` relies on input changes (often using new references), it works well with immutable data patterns, where data structures are replaced rather than mutated.

### 4. Potential Pitfalls and Tips
   - **Mutating Objects Can Cause Issues**: Angular won’t detect changes if an object’s properties change without creating a new object reference. This can lead to unexpected behavior where the UI doesn’t update as expected.
   - **Use `markForCheck()` for Manual Updates**: In some cases, you might need to manually trigger change detection for `OnPush` components using `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()`. This ensures that Angular re-evaluates the component when you know a change has occurred that Angular wouldn’t detect otherwise.

### 5. Example Usage
Imagine you have a message list where messages are only updated when a new message is added to the list:

```typescript
import { Component, ChangeDetectionStrategy, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-message-list',
  template: `<div *ngFor="let message of messages">{{ message }}</div>`,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class MessageListComponent {
  @Input() messages: string[] = [];
}
```

When a new array reference is assigned to `messages`, Angular will detect this change due to the `OnPush` strategy, but if individual messages in the array are modified without changing the array reference, no re-evaluation will occur.

### Summary
Switching to `OnPush` for components where changes are predictable and infrequent can improve your app’s efficiency, especially in large Angular applications with deep component trees. The result is a leaner, faster change detection cycle, as Angular skips over components that don’t need updating.



Setting `OnPush` on a parent component does not automatically apply it to child components. Each component in Angular has its own change detection strategy, which you need to specify individually.

Here’s how it works in practice:

- If you set a parent component to `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`, Angular will only check that parent component and its child components for changes when one of the `OnPush` conditions is met (such as an `@Input` value change).
- However, each child component still respects its own change detection strategy, regardless of the parent’s. So if a child component has the default change detection strategy, it will continue to check for changes as usual unless explicitly set to `OnPush`.

In short, the `OnPush` strategy only limits change detection for the component it is applied to and does not cascade down to child components. If you want all components in a subtree to follow `OnPush`, you’ll need to set `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` on each component explicitly.
