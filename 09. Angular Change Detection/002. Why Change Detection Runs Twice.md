The duplicate log output during change detection happens only in development mode in Angular, not in production. Here’s why:

### Development Mode Double Check

1. **Double Change Detection Cycle**:
   - In development mode, Angular runs two change detection cycles back-to-back whenever a change occurs (like updating the counter).
   - This second cycle is a “**sanity check**,” ensuring that values don’t change unexpectedly between cycles. If Angular finds a difference in the values from the first to the second cycle, it will throw an error called `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError`.

2. **Why Run It Twice?**:
   - This approach helps catch potential issues early in development by identifying unstable values that might change unexpectedly, which could lead to bugs in production.

### Example of an Unstable Value

   - For instance, if you returned a `Math.random()` value in a component’s `debugOutput` getter, each cycle would generate a different value.
   - Angular would detect this discrepancy between cycles, triggering the `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError`, signaling that the value changes in an unintended way.
   - This error helps developers identify parts of the code where values might be changing unpredictably or where side effects are happening unintentionally during the rendering phase.

### Avoiding Unstable Values

   - To avoid this error, ensure that values used in template bindings are stable and won’t change unexpectedly during the lifecycle.
   - For instance, using fixed strings or variables that aren’t recalculated on every change detection cycle avoids this issue.

### Production Mode Difference

   - In production, Angular skips this double-checking for performance reasons, only running one change detection cycle per event.
   - This ensures better efficiency without sacrificing stability, as development mode has already caught potential issues during testing.

### Optimizing Change Detection

Now that you know why Angular performs this double-check, we can explore ways to optimize Angular’s change detection to enhance performance, such as using the `OnPush` change detection strategy to limit checks only to components that actually change. Let me know if you’d like more on that!
