Note : You can remove the @Injectable if you are using element injector.

### Using the Element Injector in Angular

1. **Element Injector Overview**:
   - The **element injector** is closely tied to DOM elements and is part of Angular's injector tree. It's used for providing services that are scoped to specific components and their child components.
   - This injector is distinct from the **root environment injector**, which makes services available globally across the application.

2. **Providing Services with Element Injector**:
   - To use the element injector, you can provide a service (like `TasksService`) directly in a component's `@Component` decorator using the `providers` array.
   - This configuration allows all child components (and directives) within the component's template to access the same instance of the provided service.
   - For example, if you add `TasksService` to the `providers` array of the `TasksComponent`, both the `NewTaskComponent` and `TasksListComponent` can share the same instance of `TasksService`.

3. **Scope of the Service**:
   - The service provided via the element injector is limited to the component tree rooted at that specific component. Other components, such as the `AppComponent`, will not have access to this service unless it is provided at a higher level in the component hierarchy.
   - This encapsulation can be useful for managing state or functionality specific to a particular feature without affecting the global state of the application.

4. **Instance Management**:
   - When a service is provided in a component's `providers` array, each instance of that component will have its own separate instance of the service.
   - If you provide `TasksService` inside the `TasksListComponent`, it will get a different instance than `NewTaskComponent`, which might lead to inconsistencies if they need to share state.

### Understanding the Element Injector in Angular

* Limited Access:
        - When you provide a service (like TasksService) in a component's providers array, itâ€™s only available to that component and its child components.
        - For example, if TasksService is used in TasksComponent, the AppComponent cannot access it. Trying to do so will cause an error.

* Separate Instances:
        - Each instance of a component that provides a service gets its own instance of that service.
        - If you use TasksComponent twice, each one will have a different TasksService. Changes made in one will not affect the other.
