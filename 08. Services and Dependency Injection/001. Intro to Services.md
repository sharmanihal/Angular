In Angular, services are classes designed to **share logic and data across the application**. They provide a centralized way to handle tasks and functionality that multiple components or other services may need to access or modify. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key points about services based on the provided text:

### Purpose of Services

1. **Centralization of Logic and Data**:
   - Services allow you to centralize logic or data, so they can be reused across multiple components. For example, a single service can manage tasks data, making it accessible to multiple components.
   
2. **Reusability and Injection**:
   - Services can be injected into components, directives, and even other services. This makes them extremely versatile as shared resources throughout the app.
     
3. **Scalability**:
   - If more components are added in the future, such as a component that requires specific filtering or formatting of tasks, they can also rely on the existing service, avoiding code duplication.
