### What Are Deferrable Views?

- Deferrable Views defer the initialization and rendering of a component's view until a certain condition is met (e.g., when the component is visible on the screen).
- Unlike route-based lazy loading, this approach works at the component level within a single route.
- Ideal for optimizing scenarios where certain parts of the DOM don't need to be loaded and rendered immediately.

Say you have an Offer Component, that has timer attached to it, which should start when the user scroll to the viewport in which this Component is present.

To make sure that this component only get loaded only when the use scroll to the viewport of the component, we can do the following:
