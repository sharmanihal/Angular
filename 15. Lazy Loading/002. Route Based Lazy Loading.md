### **1. Identify Routes for Lazy Loading**
Analyze which routes make sense to lazy load. Avoid lazy loading for routes likely accessed at the app's start (e.g., the home page). For less frequently used routes, lazy loading can improve performance.

---

### **2. Modify Route Configuration**
Replace the `component` property in your route definition with the `loadComponent` property to enable lazy loading.

#### Example:
Before (eager loading):
```typescript
import { TasksComponent } from './tasks.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'tasks',
    component: TasksComponent,
  },
];
```

After (lazy loading):
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'tasks',
    loadComponent: () =>
      import('./tasks.component').then(module => module.TasksComponent),
  },
];
```

---

### **3. Remove Eager Imports**
- Remove the direct import of the `TasksComponent` from your route configuration file.
- Ensure the `loadComponent` function dynamically imports the module only when the route is accessed.

---

### **4. Handle Resolvers**
If you are using resolvers that depend on code within the lazily loaded component file:
- **Extract the resolver function** to another file, such as `user.routes.ts`, to prevent eager loading of the component file.

#### Example:
Move the `resolveUserTasks` function from the `tasks.component.ts` file to `user.routes.ts`:
```typescript
export const resolveUserTasks = () => {
  const tasksService = inject(TasksService);
  const route = inject(ActivatedRouteSnapshot);

  return tasksService.fetchTasks(route.params['userId']);
};
```

Update your route:
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'tasks',
    loadComponent: () =>
      import('./tasks.component').then(module => module.TasksComponent),
    resolve: { tasks: resolveUserTasks },
  },
];
```

---

### **5. Test Lazy Loading**
1. Open **Developer Tools** in the browser.
2. Navigate to the **Network Tab**.
3. Visit the route `/tasks` and check for a network request fetching a new chunk (e.g., `tasks.chunk.js`).
4. Confirm that the component and related code are loaded only when the route is accessed.

---

### **Key Considerations**
- Ensure **all dependencies** for the lazily loaded module are not imported elsewhere in an eager manner.
- Use lazy loading for routes unlikely accessed initially to improve startup performance.
- Always test lazy-loaded routes to confirm proper functionality.

With this approach, you now have lazy loading set up for your Angular application's routes!
