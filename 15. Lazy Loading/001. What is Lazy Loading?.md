Lazy loading in Angular is a technique to optimize the performance of your application by loading feature modules or specific parts of your app only when they are needed, instead of loading everything upfront.

Hereâ€™s a concise explanation:

- **Purpose**: Reduce the **initial bundle size**, making the application load faster, especially important for larger apps.
- **How it works**:
  - You divide your app into **feature modules** or **chunks**.
  - These chunks are configured to load only when the user navigates to a specific route associated with them.
- **Benefits**:
  1. **Improved Initial Load Time**: Only the essential parts of the app are loaded at the start.
  2. **Optimized User Experience**: Non-essential parts of the app are loaded when needed, ensuring smoother navigation and faster interactions.
  3. **Better Bandwidth Utilization**: Saves data for users, as they only download what they use.

### Key Notes:
- Lazy loading is usually implemented for **feature modules** in Angular.
- It requires properly setting up **routes** and using the `loadChildren` property.
- Angular's **router** manages the dynamic loading of the required modules.

By employing lazy loading, you strike a balance between a quick initial load time and the ability to serve complex, feature-rich applications without overwhelming users' devices or networks.
