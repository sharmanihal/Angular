Lazy loading **services** in Angular is an advanced optimization technique that complements lazy loading of components and routes. Here's how to implement it:

---

### **1. Why Lazy Load Services?**
- Some services are only used by specific routes or components.
- By lazy loading these services, you avoid loading their code until it's actually needed.
- This reduces the initial bundle size and improves app startup performance.

In the example, the `TasksService` is only used in routes related to tasks. So, it can be lazily loaded along with those routes.

---

### **2. Default Behavior of Angular Services**
By default, when you provide a service in the `root` injector (`@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })`), it is eagerly loaded when the app starts. To enable lazy loading:
- Remove the `providedIn` configuration from the service.
- Provide the service in a lazily loaded route.

---

### **3. Steps to Lazy Load Services**

#### **Step 1: Remove `providedIn` from the Service**
Modify the `TasksService` to remove the `providedIn` configuration:
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class TasksService {
  // Service implementation
}
```

#### **Step 2: Provide the Service in a Route**
In the `users.routes.ts` file (or any feature route file), add the `providers` property to a route:
```typescript
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { TasksComponent } from './tasks.component';
import { NewTaskComponent } from './new-task.component';
import { resolveUserTasks } from './resolve-user-tasks.function';
import { TasksService } from './tasks.service';

export const userRoutes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    children: [
      {
        path: ':userId/tasks',
        component: TasksComponent,
        resolve: { tasks: resolveUserTasks },
      },
      {
        path: ':userId/new',
        component: NewTaskComponent,
      },
    ],
    providers: [TasksService], // Provide the service here
  },
];
```

- **Key Points**:
  - The `providers` array specifies services that are only available to this route and its child routes.
  - This ensures the `TasksService` is only instantiated when the `users` routes are loaded.

---

### **4. How It Works**
- The `loadChildren` property in the main app routes ensures the `users` feature routes are lazily loaded.
- When the `users` routes are activated, Angular sets up the route-level injector and initializes the `TasksService`.
- If the user never navigates to a `users` route, the `TasksService` is never loaded.

---

### **5. Test the Implementation**
1. Run the application and open the **Developer Tools**.
2. Clear the **Network Tab**.
3. Navigate to the root page and observe that the `TasksService` code is not loaded.
4. Click on a user or navigate to a tasks-related route. Observe a network request for the lazily loaded chunk that includes the `TasksService`.

---

### **6. Additional Considerations**
- **Global vs. Route-Level Services**: Use lazy-loaded services for features specific to certain routes. For globally required services (e.g., authentication), keep them in the root injector.
- **Guard Dependency**: If a guard depends on a lazily loaded service, ensure the service is provided in the same route where the guard is used.
- **Avoid Circular Dependencies**: Ensure the service doesn't indirectly reference components or modules that depend on it.

---

### **7. Final Setup**

#### `app.routes.ts`
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'users',
    loadChildren: () =>
      import('./users.routes').then(module => module.userRoutes),
  },
];
```

#### `users.routes.ts`
```typescript
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { TasksComponent } from './tasks.component';
import { NewTaskComponent } from './new-task.component';
import { resolveUserTasks } from './resolve-user-tasks.function';
import { TasksService } from './tasks.service';

export const userRoutes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    children: [
      {
        path: ':userId/tasks',
        component: TasksComponent,
        resolve: { tasks: resolveUserTasks },
      },
      {
        path: ':userId/new',
        component: NewTaskComponent,
      },
    ],
    providers: [TasksService], // Lazy loading the service
  },
];
```

With this setup, both the **routes** and the **service** are loaded lazily, reducing the initial app bundle size and optimizing performance.
