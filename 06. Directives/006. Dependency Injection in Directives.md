In Angular, directives also support dependency injection, just like components. You can inject any service or even the host element into a directive, similar to how you'd access the host element in a component. Here's a streamlined example to capture these key concepts:

1. **Injecting Services or Host Elements in Directives:**
   - You can inject services like an authentication service.
   - Alternatively, you can inject the host element, allowing access to it directly within the directive.

2. **Injecting Host Element using `inject` function:**
   - Define a private property, for example, `hostElementRef`.
   - Use the `inject` function with `ElementRef` to obtain a reference to the host element. You can also add type information:
     ```typescript
     private hostElementRef = inject<ElementRef<HTMLAnchorElement>>(ElementRef);
     ```
   - The `HTMLAnchorElement` type specifies that the directive is applied to an anchor element.

3. **Accessing the Host Element's Native Element:**
   - Use `this.hostElementRef.nativeElement` to interact with the underlying HTML element. This can be useful for event handling or element manipulation in your directive.

This approach helps leverage Angular's powerful dependency injection within directives, although in most cases, directives will be less common than components in your Angular applications.
