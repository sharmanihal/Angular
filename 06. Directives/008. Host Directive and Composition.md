Here's a summary of the new concepts introduced with the `hostDirectives` property, which lets you apply a directive's behavior across multiple components without manually adding it each time. This can be useful for reusable behavior, like logging clicks on various elements or components.

### Key Points for `hostDirectives`

1. **Structural vs. Attribute Directives**: 
   - Structural directives (e.g., `*ngIf`) control the presence of an element in the DOM.
   - Attribute directives modify the appearance or behavior of an element (e.g., changing styles or handling events).

2. **Using `hostDirectives`**:
   - Instead of manually adding a directive to each component or element, you can register it in the component’s `hostDirectives` array.
   - When you use `hostDirectives`, the directive will automatically apply to the component, adding its behavior without needing to be declared in the component's template.
   - This simplifies code and reduces repetition, especially if you need the directive on multiple components or elements.

### Example Usage with a `LogDirective`

Imagine you have a `LogDirective` that logs clicks on any element it’s attached to. Here’s how you can use `hostDirectives` to add this logging behavior to other components without manual repetition:

1. **Define the `LogDirective`**:

   ```typescript
   import { Directive, ElementRef, HostListener, inject } from '@angular/core';

   @Directive({
     selector: '[appLog]'
   })
   export class LogDirective {
     private hostElement = inject(ElementRef);

     @HostListener('click')
     onLog() {
       console.log('Clicked element:', this.hostElement.nativeElement);
     }
   }
   ```

   This directive will log "Clicked element:" along with the details of the element clicked.

2. **Add `LogDirective` to Components via `hostDirectives`**:

   In any component where you want automatic logging behavior, you can use the `hostDirectives` property.

   ```typescript
   import { Component } from '@angular/core';
   import { LogDirective } from './log.directive';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-auth',
     templateUrl: './auth.component.html',
     styleUrls: ['./auth.component.css'],
     hostDirectives: [LogDirective]
   })
   export class AuthComponent {}
   ```

   Now, any time you click on the `app-auth` component, it will log the click event, thanks to the `LogDirective`.

3. **Combining `hostDirectives` and Manual Usage**:

   If you need to use `LogDirective` in additional places manually (e.g., a specific element within a template), you can still add it directly in the template:

   ```html
   <p appLog>This paragraph will log clicks manually.</p>
   ```

   This allows for flexibility—you can use `hostDirectives` to apply the directive to the entire component, and still use it directly on specific elements where needed.

### Benefits of Using `hostDirectives`

- **Reusable Behavior**: Allows you to layer behaviors, such as logging, onto multiple components or directives.
- **Less Repetition**: Reduces the need to manually add the directive in every component or element that needs it.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps components focused on their primary purpose while delegating additional behavior to directives.

By using `hostDirectives`, you can compose complex, reusable components with layered functionality while keeping your code organized and efficient.
