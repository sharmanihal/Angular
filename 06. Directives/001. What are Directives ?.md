**Directives** are special instructions that enhance the behavior, appearance, or structure of elements in a template. They allow you to add specific functionality or alter the properties of both standard HTML elements and Angular components.

Here's a breakdown:

### Key Points About Directives

1. **Enhance Existing Elements**:
   - Directives attach behavior to elements without needing to add new HTML. For example, the `NgModel` directive is used for two-way data binding on an `<input>` element, allowing it to work seamlessly with Angular's change detection.

2. **No Template**:
   - Unlike components, directives don’t have their own template. They act on existing elements and modify their behavior, appearance, or structure. Components are essentially directives with a template, making them more suitable for complex UI elements.

3. **Types of Directives**:
   - **Attribute Directives**: Modify the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. For instance, `NgClass` and `NgStyle` change the style of elements dynamically.
   - **Structural Directives**: Change the DOM layout by adding or removing elements. Examples include `NgIf`, `NgFor`, and `NgSwitch`. Structural directives are prefixed with an asterisk (`*`) to indicate that they impact the DOM structure.
   - **Custom Directives**: You can create custom directives to apply specific behavior across elements, like a directive that automatically highlights text or restricts certain user inputs.

4. **Example**:
   - Using `NgModel` as a directive:
     ```html
     <input [(ngModel)]="username">
     ```
   - Here, `NgModel` is enhancing the `<input>` by binding the `username` value to it. It doesn’t add new HTML, but it brings in powerful functionality.

5. **Why Use Directives?**:
   - They help keep components cleaner by moving reusable logic (like showing/hiding elements, managing focus) out of templates.
   - They enable behavior reusability and customization of HTML elements without creating additional markup.

In short, directives let you add additional, reusable functionality to elements and components, making them versatile tools in Angular's component-based structure.
