**Using ng-template:** Wrap the content (like a paragraph) inside ng-template in the component template. This ensures that the content isn’t displayed immediately and can be controlled by the directive.

Note: This is a boiler plate code and can be removed if we use (*) with our directive.
```html
  <ng-template appAppAuth='admin'>
    <p >Only for admin</p>
  </ng-template>
```

**Now that we have the html is place we will be Injecting TemplateRef and ViewContainerRef:**
1. TemplateRef provides access to the content within ng-template. i.e. ```<p>``` tag.
2. ViewContainerRef provides a reference to the location in the DOM where the template should be rendered or cleared.

**Creating and Clearing Views in Directive:**
1. Use viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(templateRef) to render the content when the permission matches.
2. Use viewContainer.clear() to remove the content when the permission doesn’t match.

   Note: Since we want this code to run , when ever either the userPermission signal or activePermission signal changes, we have written the code inside the effect().

**Asterisk Syntax** for Structural Directives: By using *appAppAuth="'role'", Angular interprets this as syntactic sugar for wrapping the content in an ng-template and setting up property binding, evaluating the appAppAuth input as TypeScript code.
