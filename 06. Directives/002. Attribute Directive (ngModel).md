The `ngModel` directive is an Angular attribute directive that enables two-way data binding for form elements like input fields, text areas, and dropdowns. By adding it to an element, `ngModel` binds the element's value to a component property and keeps it in sync, updating it in real time as the user types. In addition to two-way binding, it also applies specific CSS classes (e.g., `ng-touched`, `ng-untouched`, `ng-dirty`, `ng-pristine`, etc.) to reflect the element's state, which can be useful for validation and styling.

In summary, `ngModel` enhances elements by:
1. Allowing two-way data binding to sync values between the component and template.
2. Applying CSS classes to reflect the form control's state, such as `ng-touched` and `ng-dirty`.

This is why `ngModel` is categorized as an attribute directive: it enhances an elementâ€™s behavior without altering its structure.

Note: We can also use the ngModel without two way binding in order to just get the dynamic class addition feature of it.

```html
<input type="text" ngModel>
```
