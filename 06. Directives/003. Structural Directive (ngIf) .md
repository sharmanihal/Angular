A **structural directive** in Angular is a type of directive that modifies the structure of the DOM by adding, removing, or manipulating elements based on specific conditions or logic. Structural directives typically use the `*` prefix (such as `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`) and operate by transforming the template structure, 
making Angular dynamically change the layout of the page without rendering unnecessary elements, thereby improving performance and efficiency.

The `*ngIf` directive is an Angular structural directive that conditionally adds or removes elements from the DOM based on an expression. When the expression evaluates to `true`, the element is included in the DOM; when it’s `false`, the element is removed entirely. This allows Angular to control what’s rendered on the page dynamically, optimizing performance by not displaying unnecessary elements.

In short, `*ngIf` modifies the structure of the DOM by:
1. Adding elements to the DOM when the specified condition is `true`.
2. Removing elements from the DOM entirely when the condition is `false`.

This behavior makes `*ngIf` a structural directive, as it changes the DOM structure rather than simply enhancing an existing element’s behavior or properties.
