In Angular, **pipe chaining** allows you to apply multiple pipes to a single value within a template expression. This feature lets you combine the functionality of different pipes, transforming the output step by step. Here's how pipe chaining works and some important considerations:

### How Pipe Chaining Works

1. **Basic Syntax**: You use the pipe operator (`|`) to apply pipes in sequence. The output of one pipe becomes the input for the next pipe.

   **Example**:
   ```html
   {{ value | pipe1 | pipe2 | pipe3 }}
   ```

   In this example, `value` is first processed by `pipe1`, then the output of `pipe1` is passed to `pipe2`, and finally, the output of `pipe2` is passed to `pipe3`.

2. **Order of Execution**: The pipes are executed from left to right. This means that the first pipe runs first, and its output is passed to the next pipe in the chain.

3. **Multiple Arguments**: Each pipe can accept multiple arguments. You can provide arguments to each pipe as needed.
