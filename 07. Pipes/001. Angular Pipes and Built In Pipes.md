Pipes in Angular are a way to transform data in the template before displaying it to the user. They allow you to take data in one format and transform it into a desired output format directly within the HTML template.

### Built-in Pipes in Angular

Here is a list of some commonly used built-in pipes Angular provides:

1. **DatePipe**: Formats dates.
2. **UpperCasePipe**: Converts text to uppercase.
3. **LowerCasePipe**: Converts text to lowercase.
4. **CurrencyPipe**: Formats numbers as currency.
5. **DecimalPipe**: Formats numbers with decimals.
6. **PercentPipe**: Formats numbers as percentages.
7. **JsonPipe**: Converts an object into a JSON string.
8. **SlicePipe**: Extracts a section of an array or string.
9. **AsyncPipe**: Handles asynchronous operations by subscribing to Observables or Promises.
10. **TitleCasePipe**: Converts the first letter of each word in a string to uppercase.

Here’s how you can use Angular’s `DatePipe` both with and without configuration:

### Without Configuration
Using `DatePipe` without any configuration will display the date in the default format (mediumDate), which usually looks like this: `MMM d, y` (e.g., `Oct 31, 2024`).

```html
<p>{{ today | date }}</p>
```

If `today` is a JavaScript `Date` object, the output might be something like:
```
Oct 31, 2024
```

### With Configuration
You can configure `DatePipe` by specifying a date format. Angular provides a few common format options, such as `short`, `medium`, `long`, and `full`. You can also create a custom format by specifying a string of date symbols.

#### Example 1: Predefined Format
```html
<p>{{ today | date:'short' }}</p>
```
**Output**: `10/31/24, 12:00 PM`
