Sort Pipe:

```typescript

import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'sort',
  standalone: true
})
export class SortPipe implements PipeTransform {

  transform(value: string[] | number[], direction :'asc' |'desc'='asc') {
    
    const sorted=[...value];

    sorted.sort((a,b)=>{
      if(direction==='asc'){
        return a > b ? 1 : -1
      }else{
        return a > b ? -1 : 1
      }
    })
  }

}

```


## One Potential Problem and how to fix it :

In the context of using a custom `SortPipe` in Angular, the paragraph explains a common behavior regarding how Angular manages change detection, particularly with arrays and objects. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key points discussed:

### Understanding SortPipe Behavior

1. **Pipe Caching**: 
   - When you apply a pipe in Angular, such as `SortPipe`, Angular caches the result of the `transform` method. This means that if the input value (like an array) does not change, Angular will not re-run the `transform` method.
   - This caching mechanism is designed to improve performance since pipes can be executed frequently in templates.

2. **Array Mutability**: 
   - If you modify an element within an array (like changing a temperature value in `historicTemperatures`), the reference to the original array remains the same. Angular checks for changes by comparing references, so it does not recognize the modification as a change that requires the pipe to re-execute.
   - In JavaScript, arrays and objects are reference types, meaning that changing a property or an index does not create a new reference. Thus, Angular sees the same pointer to the original array.

3. **Change Detection Mechanics**:
   - Angular uses the strict comparison of the previous and current values. If the reference to the object or array does not change, Angular assumes there are no changes, even if internal values have been updated.
   - To trigger a re-evaluation of the `SortPipe`, you need to provide a new reference to the array. This involves creating a new array rather than just modifying an existing one.

4. **Updating the Array**:
   - To ensure that the `transform` method of `SortPipe` runs again, you should copy the existing array into a new one, modify the required value in that new array, and then replace the original array with this new array.
   - For example:
     ```typescript
     onReset() {
       const newTemps = [...this.historicTemperatures]; // Create a new copy of the array
       newTemps[index] = newValue; // Modify the copied array
       this.historicTemperatures = newTemps; // Replace the old array with the new reference
     }
     ```

5. **Result of the Update**:
   - By replacing the original array with a new one, Angular now has a different reference. As a result, the `SortPipe` will re-run, updating the sorted list displayed in the UI.
   - Additionally, since the sorting can change the order of items, the displayed indexes in the UI may not align with the original indexes in the data array, but this is an expected behavior when the list is dynamically sorted.

### Summary

The main takeaway from this explanation is that when using Angular pipes, especially with arrays and objects, it's crucial to understand how reference types work in JavaScript. To ensure that Angular detects changes and re-executes the `transform` method, you need to modify the entire array (or object) reference instead of just changing individual elements. This understanding helps maintain proper reactivity and ensures that your application behaves as expected when data is updated.
