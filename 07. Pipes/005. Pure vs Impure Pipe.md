In the context of Angular, the paragraph explains an alternative approach for handling change detection in custom pipes by configuring them as **impure pipes**. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the key points discussed:

### Impure Pipes in Angular

1. **Impure vs. Pure Pipes**:
   - **Pure Pipes** (the default behavior): A pipe is considered pure if it only depends on its input values. Angular will cache the result of the `transform` method and only re-run it when the input values change (i.e., when the reference to the input changes).
   - **Impure Pipes**: By setting the `pure` property in the pipe's configuration to `false`, you tell Angular that this pipe may produce different results even if the input values (the references) have not changed. This disables the caching mechanism.

2. **Disabling Caching**:
   - Setting `pure: false` means that Angular will execute the `transform` method every time the change detection cycle runs for that template, regardless of whether the input value has changed.
   - This can be beneficial in cases where the internal state of an array or object might change, but you still want the pipe to react to these changes.

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Using impure pipes should be done cautiously. Since the `transform` method will be executed every time change detection runs, it can lead to performance degradation, especially if the pipe is complex or if the change detection is triggered frequently.
   - Overusing impure pipes can slow down your application significantly because Angular will call the transform method for every data-binding expression in the template that includes the pipe.

4. **Use Case for Impure Pipes**:
   - Impure pipes are useful in specific scenarios, such as when you need to observe or react to changes in an array or object that Angular cannot track through reference changes.
   - For example, if you're manipulating an array internally and want to reflect those changes in the UI without replacing the array reference, an impure pipe would be a suitable choice.

5. **Example of Declaring an Impure Pipe**:
   To create an impure pipe, you can configure it like this:

   ```typescript
   import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

   @Pipe({
     name: 'temp',
     pure: false, // Set to false to make this an impure pipe
   })
   export class TemperaturePipe implements PipeTransform {
     transform(value: number, targetUnit: string): number {
       // Transformation logic
       return targetUnit === 'C' ? ((value - 32) * 5) / 9 : value; // Example conversion
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Result of Using Impure Pipes**:
   - With impure pipes, when you click items or make changes in the template, Angular will re-evaluate the pipe’s `transform` method. This ensures that any internal changes to arrays or objects are reflected in the UI.
   - However, the downside is the potential performance impact, so it should be employed judiciously.

### Summary

The discussion highlights how you can create impure pipes in Angular to react to internal changes in data structures, bypassing the default caching mechanism of pure pipes. While this can enhance the reactivity of your application, it comes with performance trade-offs, so it's essential to use impure pipes selectively and with a clear understanding of their implications for change detection.
