### Module Introduction

In this section, you’ll explore the concept of Angular modules, an older but still relevant way of structuring Angular applications. While standalone components are now the recommended approach for building Angular apps, Angular modules offer an alternative that has been around since Angular 2 (released in 2016). This means that many existing projects still use modules, making it important to understand how they work.

Here's what you'll learn about Angular modules:

**1. Understanding Angular Modules:**
   - How they group components together and organize applications.
   - The role they play in older projects and their historic significance.

**2. Creating and Using Modules:**
   - How to declare and export components within a module.
   - Why using modules can be beneficial in certain scenarios.

**3. Combining and Sharing Modules:**
   - Techniques for combining multiple modules.
   - How to share functionalities between modules for better code organization.

By understanding Angular modules, you’ll gain a comprehensive view of both modern and legacy approaches to building Angular applications, preparing you to work with a wide range of projects.


# Understanding Angular Modules

## Purpose of Angular Modules

- **Group Components**: 
  Instead of managing component dependencies directly at the component level (as with standalone components), Angular modules let you group related components, directives, and pipes into a single module.

- **Simplifies Component Decorators**: 
  When using standalone components, each component specifies the other components it depends on through an `imports` array in its decorator. With modules, this `imports` array is managed at the module level, making the individual component decorators simpler.

- **Legacy and Compatibility**: 
  Many existing projects use modules because they were the only way to structure Angular apps before Angular 14 introduced standalone components. This makes modules crucial for maintaining older projects or integrating with legacy codebases.

## How Angular Modules Work

You create a module using the `@NgModule` decorator. A module can include:

- **declarations**: 
  Components, directives, and pipes that belong to this module.

- **imports**: 
  Other modules whose exported functionality is needed in this module.

- **exports**: 
  Components, directives, and pipes that should be accessible to other modules.

### Example

If your app component uses custom components like `HeaderComponent`, `UserComponent`, and `TasksComponent`, instead of importing each component individually in the app component’s `imports` array, you can declare all of them in a module:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { HeaderComponent } from './header/header.component';
import { UserComponent } from './user/user.component';
import { TasksComponent } from './tasks/tasks.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    HeaderComponent,
    UserComponent,
    TasksComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
