### Module Introduction

In this section, you’ll explore the concept of Angular modules, an older but still relevant way of structuring Angular applications. While standalone components are now the recommended approach for building Angular apps, Angular modules offer an alternative that has been around since Angular 2 (released in 2016). This means that many existing projects still use modules, making it important to understand how they work.

Here's what you'll learn about Angular modules:

**1. Understanding Angular Modules:**
   - How they group components together and organize applications.
   - The role they play in older projects and their historic significance.

**2. Creating and Using Modules:**
   - How to declare and export components within a module.
   - Why using modules can be beneficial in certain scenarios.

**3. Combining and Sharing Modules:**
   - Techniques for combining multiple modules.
   - How to share functionalities between modules for better code organization.

By understanding Angular modules, you’ll gain a comprehensive view of both modern and legacy approaches to building Angular applications, preparing you to work with a wide range of projects.
