# Migrating Angular Application to Modules

At this point, you learned how to create an Angular module, bootstrap your Angular application with such a module, register non-Standalone Components, register other modules, and merge them into this module. You also learned how to register Standalone Components so that you can build applications that use both kinds of Components.

It's also worth mentioning here that Standalone Components can also use modules. You can not just add Standalone Components to modules, but also modules to Standalone Components. 

## Example: Using Modules in Standalone Components

In our application, in the new task component, we have a Standalone Component. In its imports array, we're not importing some other kind of component, but instead, a module: the `FormsModule` that is provided by Angular. 

The `FormsModule` is an NgModule that has been built by the Angular team and provides a collection of Directives and generally features we might want to use in our application. We can easily use that in a Standalone Component by adding it to this imports array like this:

```typescript
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-new-task',
  templateUrl: './new-task.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./new-task.component.css'],
  imports: [FormsModule]  // Importing FormsModule
})
export class NewTaskComponent {
  // Component logic
}
```
