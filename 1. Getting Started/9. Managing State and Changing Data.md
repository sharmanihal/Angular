**Managing and Changing State Value:**

Combining event handling with dynamic content updates is a powerful way to create interactive applications in Angular. 

Instead of a console log trigger based on the event, we can make changes to the UI by changing the value of state in this case (selectedUser state).

```
onSelectUser(){
    this.selectedUser = DUMMY_USERS[Math.floor(Math.random()*DUMMY_USERS.length)];
  }
```

**Angular State and Change Detection**:

1. State Management: Data stored in properties of a component, known as the state, impacts the UI when changed.
   
2. Change Detection: Angular automatically detects data changes and updates the UI accordingly.
   
3. Zone.js: Angular uses a library called zone.js to listen for user events and other triggers (like timers). When an event occurs, zone.js checks for changes in the Angular application.
   
4. Automatic UI Updates: Thanks to zone.js, Angular can automatically update the UI without additional work from the developer. This creates a seamless experience where changing a property value in the component class reflects immediately in the UI.

This mechanism allows Angular to efficiently manage and update the user interface based on the applicationâ€™s state.
