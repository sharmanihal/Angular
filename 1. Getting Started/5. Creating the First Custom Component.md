**Here’s a basic example** of creating a new Angular component using the @Component decorator. This example includes the selector, templateUrl, and standalone properties:

Explanation:

**selector**: Defines the custom HTML tag for the component.

**templateUrl**: Points to the HTML file that contains the component’s template.

**standalone**: When set to true, it indicates that the component is standalone and does not need to be declared in an NgModule.

**Since the above component is standalone, we would need to bootstrap it similarly to the AppComponent.**
To bootstrap a standalone component like HeaderComponent, you’ll need to modify your main.ts file. Here’s how you can do it:

**Import the Component:** Import your standalone component into the main.ts file.

**Bootstrap the Component:** Use the bootstrapApplication function from @angular/platform-browser to bootstrap the standalone component.

**However, this is not how you typically render the components.** In a typical Angular application, components are organized in a hierarchical tree structure, with the AppComponent serving as the root component.

To use a HeaderComponent within the AppComponent, you need to follow these steps:

**Import the HeaderComponent:** Add the HeaderComponent to the imports array in the @Component decorator of the AppComponent.

**Use the HeaderComponent in the Template:** Include the HeaderComponent selector in the app.component.html file.

```<app-header></app-header>```
