The @Input decorator in Angular is used to define an input property in a component, allowing data to be passed from a parent component to a child component. 

Here’s a brief overview of how it works:

**1. Define the Input Property:** In the child component, you mark a property with the @Input decorator.

**Note :** This is a common TypeScript error when using the @Input decorator in Angular. TypeScript expects properties to be initialized, and since the @Input property is set by Angular, TypeScript doesn’t see it as initialized.
To resolve this, you can use the non-null assertion operator (!). This tells TypeScript that the property will definitely be initialized by Angular.

**2. Bind to the Input Property:** In the parent component, you bind a value to this input property using property binding.

**Required Input:**

You can mark @Input properties as required using the required option. This ensures that the parent component must provide a value for these inputs, otherwise, Angular will throw an error.
```
@Input({required:true}) avatar!:String
@Input({required:true}) name!:String;
```
