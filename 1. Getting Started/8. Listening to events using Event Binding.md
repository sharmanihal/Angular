**In Angular, you can listen to events such as clicks using event binding. **

This is done by wrapping the event name in parentheses () and specifying the event handler in your component.

For example, to listen to a click event on a button and log something to the console, you can do the following:

In your component’s HTML file you can add a click event listener:

```
<div>
    <button (click)="onSelectUser()">
        <img [src]='imagePath'/>
        <span>{{selectedUser.name}}</span>
    </button>
</div>
```

And in your component’s TypeScript file:

```
onSelectUser(){
    console.log('User selected');
  }
```
