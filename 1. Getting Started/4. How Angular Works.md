An Angular app starts with a series of key steps, which are important to understand. Here's a simple breakdown:

**1. Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)**

Angular uses a tool called the Angular CLI to set up the app. You can create a new Angular app by running:

```
ng new my-app
cd my-app
npm i
ng serve
```

This command initializes a new Angular project with all the necessary files and folders.

**2. Entry Point: main.ts**

The first file that runs in an Angular app is main.ts. It is the entry point for the app and looks something like this:
```
platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule).catch(err => console.error(err));
```

This line tells Angular to bootstrap (start) the application using the AppModule.

**3. AppModule (app.module.ts)**

The AppModule is the root module of the app. It declares the components and services that your app will use. It might look like this:
```
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Here, AppComponent is the root component that is bootstrapped when the app starts.

**4. Root Component: app.component.ts**

The AppComponent is the root component where the initial HTML is rendered. It has a TypeScript file (app.component.ts) and an HTML file (app.component.html). The app.component.ts defines the logic, and app.component.html contains the template (HTML). Example:

```
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'my-angular-app';
}
```
**5. index.html**

This is the actual HTML file loaded by the browser. It contains a single Angular component selector (like <app-root></app-root>), which is the placeholder for rendering the Angular components.


**6. Starting the App**

When you run ng serve, the Angular CLI compiles your code and starts a local development server. The app is served in the browser, and Angular takes care of dynamically updating the view as you interact with the application.

```
To sum it up:

main.ts bootstraps AppModule.

AppModule declares AppComponent.

AppComponent renders the content in index.html.

This is how a basic Angular app starts!
```


**In the latest versions of Angular** (starting from Angular 15), there's an option to create standalone components and bypass the need for a traditional AppModule. This change offers a more streamlined way to bootstrap an Angular application without the overhead of managing an entire module file for simple use cases.

Here's an overview of how Angular works without an AppModule:

1. Standalone Components

Angular now allows components to be standalone, meaning they donâ€™t need to be part of a module. A standalone component can directly import any dependencies it needs, such as Angular directives, pipes, or other components.


2. App Structure Without AppModule

When you create a new Angular app without the traditional module setup, you start with a standalone component that directly bootstraps the application.

Example Structure:

1. main.ts: Instead of bootstrapping an AppModule, you now bootstrap a standalone component directly.
```
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```
The bootstrapApplication method directly bootstraps the AppComponent (or any other standalone component).



2. app.component.ts: The AppComponent is now a standalone component. You declare it as standalone and import necessary dependencies in the component's metadata.
```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true, // Marking this as standalone
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
  imports: [] // You can import other standalone components, directives, or pipes here
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'my-angular-app';
}
```

3. index.html: The index.html remains the same as before, where Angular mounts the app:
```
<app-root></app-root>
```


3. Key Differences from the Traditional Approach:

No AppModule: There's no need to define a root module anymore. Instead, you bootstrap the standalone component directly.

More Modular: Each standalone component can import its own dependencies directly, which simplifies the structure for smaller apps.

Optional Modules: You can still use modules if needed, but they are now optional, giving developers more flexibility.


4. Benefits of Standalone Components:

Faster and Simpler: Without the need for a module, the app becomes faster to set up and simpler to maintain, especially for small-scale applications.

More Modular Architecture: This encourages better separation of concerns, as each standalone component can manage its own dependencies.


Example for Bootstrapping Angular App Without Modules:

1. main.ts:
```
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));

```
2. app.component.ts:
```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  template: `<h1>{{ title }}</h1>`,
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Angular Standalone App';
}
```


In summary, the latest Angular versions introduce standalone components, allowing apps to start without a traditional module (AppModule). Instead, you directly bootstrap the main component with bootstrapApplication, which simplifies the setup and structure, especially for smaller applications.
