In Angular, pipes are a powerful feature that allows you to transform the data before displaying it in the template. They are especially useful for formatting data like dates, currencies, numbers, or custom data transformations. Here's a summary of using pipes, using the example provided:
**1. Using Built-In Pipes:**
- Angular comes with built-in pipes, like DatePipe, which help transform dates into more readable formats.
- To use a pipe in a template, you use the pipe symbol (|), followed by the pipe's name. For example:

    
```
    <time>{{ task.dueDate | date: 'fullDate' }}</time>
```
Here, the date pipe transforms task.dueDate into a more human-readable format. The 'fullDate' parameter specifies the formatting style (e.g., "Monday, October 17, 2024").

**2. Importing Required Pipes:**
Some pipes, like DatePipe, need to be imported from @angular/common:
```
    import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';

```
After importing, add DatePipe to the imports array in your module or component to make it available for use.

**3. Configuring the Pipe:**
- Pipes can accept parameters to customize their output. For instance, the date pipe allows different formatting options like 'short', 'medium', 'fullDate', etc.
- Use a colon (:) after the pipe name to provide parameters:

```
    <time>{{ task.dueDate | date: 'short' }}</time>
```
Here, 'short' would output a compact date format, while 'fullDate' gives a more detailed one. Adjust based on your preference or application needs.

**4. Result:**
In the template:
```
    <app-card>
      <article>
        <h2>{{ task.title }}</h2>
        <time>{{ task.dueDate | date: 'fullDate' }}</time>
        <p>{{ task.summary }}</p>
        <p class="actions">
          <button (click)="onCompleteTask()">Complete</button>
        </p>
      </article>
    </app-card>
```
The task.dueDate is now formatted to display in a more readable manner, making it easier for users to understand.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Pipes simplify data presentation without needing complex logic in the component.
- Angular includes various built-in pipes (e.g., date, currency, uppercase), and you can also create custom pipes for unique transformations.
- They are easy to use and keep the template clean by offloading data transformation logic.

This approach ensures that your date and other data types are presented in a user-friendly way directly within your Angular templates.
