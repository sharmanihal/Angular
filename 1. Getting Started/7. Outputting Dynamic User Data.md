In Angular, you can use double curly braces {{ }} for interpolation to bind data from your TypeScript file to your HTML template. 
 
This allows you to dynamically display the value of any variable defined in your componentâ€™s .ts file within the corresponding .html file.

For example, if you have a variable **selectedUser** in your component:

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfb144d4-f07e-4a76-a216-b84ea6bca808)


You can display this variable in your template like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4a56ace-c760-4b29-bc14-ab2ff7cf0de6)
