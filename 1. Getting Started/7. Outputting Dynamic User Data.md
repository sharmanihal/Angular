**Dynamic Content using String Interpolation:**
In Angular, you can use double curly braces {{ }} for interpolation to bind any public data from your TypeScript file to your HTML template. 
 
This allows you to dynamically display the value of any public property defined in your componentâ€™s .ts file within the corresponding .html file.

For example, if you have a variable **selectedUser** in your component:

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfb144d4-f07e-4a76-a216-b84ea6bca808)


You can display this variable in your template like this:

**Property Binding and Outputting Computed Values:**

We can also use string interpolation for property binding as well (But it is generally not a recommended approach):

The recommended approach for property binding is to use [] on the property itself:

**Attribute Binding**
In the previous lecture, you were introduced to "Property Binding" - a key Angular feature that allows you to bind element properties to dynamic values.

For example, <img [src]="someSrc"> binds the src property of the underlying HTMLImageElement DOM object to the value stored in someSrc.

Whilst it might look like you're binding the src attribute of the <img> tag, you're actually NOT doing that. Instead, property binding really targets the underlying DOM object property (in this case a property that's also called src) and binds that.

This might look like a subtle detail (and often it indeed doesn't matter) but it's important to understand this difference between element attributes and property. [This Article](https://jakearchibald.com/2024/attributes-vs-properties/) can help with understanding this difference.

Whilst it won't make a difference in Angular apps in many cases, it DOES matter if you're trying to set attributes on elements dynamically. Attributes which don't have an equally-named underlying property.

For example, when binding [ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), you can't target an underlying DOM object property.

Since "Property Binding" wants to target properties (and not attributes), that can be a problem. That's why Angular offers a slight variation of the "Property Binding" syntax that does allow you to bind attributes to dynamic values.

It looks like this:
```
<div 
  role="progressbar" 
  [attr.aria-valuenow]="currentVal" 
  [attr.aria-valuemax]="maxVal">...</div>
```
By adding attr in front of the attribute name you want to bind dynamically, you're "telling" Angular that it shouldn't try to find a property with the specified name but instead bind the respective attribute - in the example above, the aria-valuenow and aria-valuemax attributes would be bound dynamically.
