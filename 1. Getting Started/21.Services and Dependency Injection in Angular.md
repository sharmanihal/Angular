### Services:
**1. Why Use a Service?**
- Keeping components lean: Angular best practices suggest keeping components focused on their specific UI responsibilities.
- Centralized data management: The TaskService allows tasks to be managed centrally, making the data accessible to multiple components like TasksComponent, NewTaskComponent, and more.
- Reusable logic: The service provides a single place to store and manipulate tasks, making the logic reusable across the application.

**2. Creating the Service**
- The service is created as a new file named tasks.service.ts in the tasks folder.
- Inside the file, a class TasksService is defined:
```
    import { NewTaskData } from "./task.model";

    export class TaskService {
      private tasks: Task[] = [
        {
          id: "t1",
          userId: "u1",
          title: "Master Angular",
          summary: "Learn all the basic and advanced features of Angular & how to apply them.",
          dueDate: "2025-12-31",
        }
      ];
```
**3. Adding Methods to the Service**
**Get User Tasks:**
```
getUserTasks(userId: string) {
  return this.tasks.filter((task) => task.userId === userId);
}
```
This method filters tasks based on userId and returns only the tasks for that specific user.

**Add Task:**

```
addTask(task: NewTaskData, userId: string) {
  this.tasks.unshift({
    id: new Date().getTime().toString(),
    userId: userId,
    title: task.title,
    dueDate: task.date,
    summary: task.summary,
  });
}
```
Adds a new task to the beginning of the tasks array using the provided data and userId.

**Remove Task:**
```
removeTask(id: string) {
  this.tasks = this.tasks.filter((task) => task.id !== id);
}
```
Removes the task with the specified id from the tasks array.



### Dependency Injection:

Dependency Injection (DI) is a key concept in Angular and is especially useful when working with services like the TaskService. Let’s break down why we use DI, how it works in Angular, and how we can set it up using the provided example.
**1. Why Use Dependency Injection (DI)?**
- Shared Instances: One major benefit of DI is that it allows us to share a single instance of a class (such as a service) across multiple components. This means that all components that use the service will operate on the same instance, thus keeping the data consistent throughout the application.
- Loose Coupling: DI helps in achieving loose coupling by letting Angular manage the instantiation of services and their dependencies. This makes components easier to maintain and test since they don’t directly manage the lifecycle of their dependencies.
- Centralized Data Management: Using a shared instance of a service like TaskService ensures that data management is centralized. If one component updates the tasks, other components automatically reflect those changes without needing to reinitialize the service.

**2. Setting Up Dependency Injection in Angular**
- Marking the Service as Injectable:
        To enable Angular to inject a service, we must mark it as injectable using the @Injectable decorator:
  
```
    import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
    import { NewTaskData, Task } from "./task.model";

    @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
    export class TaskService {
      // Service logic here...
    }
```
- @Injectable tells Angular that this class can be injected into other classes (components, other services, etc.).
- Setting providedIn: 'root' ensures that a singleton instance of the service is created and shared across the entire application.

**Injecting the Service into a Component:**
- To use the service in a component, inject it through the constructor:

```
        import { Component, Input } from "@angular/core";
        import { TaskService } from "./task.service";
        import { NewTaskData } from "./task.model";

        @Component({
          selector: "app-tasks",
          standalone: true,
          templateUrl: "./tasks.component.html",
          styleUrls: ["./tasks.component.css"],
        })
        export class TasksComponent {
          @Input({ required: true }) userId!: string;

          constructor(private taskService: TaskService) {}

          //or

     /*       import { inject } from '@angular/core';
              import { TaskService } from './task.service';

              export class TasksComponent {
              private taskService = inject(TaskService);*/

          get selectedUserTasks() {
            return this.taskService.getUserTasks(this.userId);
          }

          onCompleteTask(id: string) {
            this.taskService.removeTask(id);
          }

          onAddTask(task: NewTaskData) {
            this.taskService.addTask(task, this.userId);
          }
        }
```
**How DI Works Here:**
- The TaskService is declared as a dependency in the TasksComponent constructor.
- The private keyword automatically creates a property in the TasksComponent to store the service instance.
- Angular then handles the creation of the TaskService and injects it into the component when the component is instantiated.
