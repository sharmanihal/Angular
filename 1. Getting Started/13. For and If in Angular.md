**The new way to write for loop:**

The @for block in Angular is used to iterate over a collection and render a block of content for each item in that collection. 

```
@for(user of users; track user.id){
      <li>
        <app-user [user]="user" (select)="onSelectUser($event)"/>
      </li>
}
```

@for(user of users; track user.id):

1. This line starts the @for loop, which iterates over each user in the users collection.
2. The track user.id part is used to uniquely identify each item in the collection. This helps Angular optimize the rendering process by keeping track of each item using its id.

**The new way to write if block:**

The @if and @else blocks in Angular are used to conditionally render content based on the evaluation of an expression.

```
 @if(selectedUser){
    <app-tasks [name]="selectedUser.name"/>
  }
  @else {
    <p id="fallback">Select a user to see their task !!</p>
  }
```
