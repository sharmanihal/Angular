### Two way binding:
Let's go over the concept of two-way data binding with ngModel in Angular, keeping in mind your detailed explanation above.
What is Two-Way Data Binding with ngModel?

Two-way data binding in Angular allows a component's property to stay synchronized with a form input element. It means that:
```
    Any changes made in the input field will automatically update the property in the component.
    Any changes made to that property in the component will automatically reflect in the input field.
```

This synchronization makes it easier to work with form inputs and to keep the UI updated with user input.

### Example Scenario: Using ngModel for a Simple Input

Imagine you have a simple input field where a user can enter a title for a task. You want the title to be stored in a property called enteredTitle inside the component and automatically update every time the user types into the input field.

**1. Setting Up the Component Property:**
```

import { FormsModule, NgModel } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-new-task',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [FormsModule],
  templateUrl: './new-task.component.html',
  styleUrl: './new-task.component.css'
})
export class NewTaskComponent {
  enteredTitle='';
}
```
Note : FormsModule is necessary to enable the ngModel directive, which is part of Angularâ€™s form handling features.

**2. Using ngModel in the Template:**


In new-task.component.html:

```
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="enteredTitle" placeholder="Enter task title" />
<p>Your task title is: {{ enteredTitle }}</p>
```
- [(ngModel)]="enteredTitle": This syntax sets up two-way binding.
- The square brackets [ ] represent property binding, which updates the input field when the enteredTitle changes.
- The parentheses ( ) represent event binding, which updates enteredTitle whenever the input value changes.
- Combined, [()] creates a two-way binding, meaning the enteredTitle is updated whenever the user types, and the input field value updates if the enteredTitle is changed in the code.
