Angular CLI: The Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool which allows you to scaffold, develop, test, deploy, and maintain Angular applications directly from a command shell.

Angular CLI is published on npm as the @angular/cli package and includes a binary named ng. Commands invoking ng are using the Angular CLI.
