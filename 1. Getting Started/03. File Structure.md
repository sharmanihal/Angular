In a typical Angular project that uses TypeScript and npm, the root-level files include:

**The below 2 files are for project dependencies that will be used in our project.**

**package.json:** This file includes metadata about the project and its dependencies.

**package-lock.json or yarn.lock:** These files lock the versions of the dependencies to ensure consistency across environments.


**angular.json:** This file is specific to Angular and is used to configure Angular CLI commands.

**README.md:** This file usually contains information about the project, such as how to install and run it.

**.gitignore:** This file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in the project.

**src/:** This directory contains the application's source code.

**node_modules/:** This directory contains all the npm packages on which your project depends. It's created when you run the npm install.

**These 3 files are mainly concerned with the Typescript conversion to Javascript under the hood, using Angular CLI.**

**tsconfig.json:** The TypeScript compiler uses this file to determine which files to compile and how to compile them.

**tsconfig.spec.json:** This file is used for TypeScript compiler configuration for the test code. It typically includes all spec files and excludes the main application file.

**tsconfig.app.json:** This file is used for TypeScript compiler configuration for the application code. It typically includes the src/main.ts file and excludes test files.



**Style.css File:** This file will be used to specify CSS that will be applied to all the components of the Angular Project.
