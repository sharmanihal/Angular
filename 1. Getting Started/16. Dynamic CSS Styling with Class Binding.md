### Objective:
We want to highlight the currently selected user in the UI, making it clear whoâ€™s active by adding a CSS class conditionally.

### Example Code:
```
<div>
    <button [class.active]="selected" (click)="onSelectUser()">
        <img [src]='imagePath'/>
        <span>{{user.name}}</span>
    </button>
</div>
```
What's Happening Here:
- [class.active]="selected": This binds the active class to the button. If selected is true, the active class is added, giving the highlighted look.
- The Result: When you click on a user, that user remains highlighted, making it visually clear which user is selected.

- Note: We are getting the "selected" property as input from the app component, where we render the user component for each user.

- ```
   @for(user of users; track user.id){
      <li>
        <app-user [user]="user" (select)="onSelectUser($event)" [selected]="user.id==selectedUserId"/>
      </li>
    }
  ```
