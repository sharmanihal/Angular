### Structural Directives

In Angular, *ngIf and *ngFor are structural directives used to control the rendering of elements in a template. They are powerful tools that allow you to dynamically show or hide elements and iterate over collections of data.

Example of *ngFor and *ngIf with else:

```
<div *ngIf="showUsers; else noUsers">
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let user of users">
      {{ user.name }}
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<ng-template #noUsers>
  <p>No users available. Please check back later!</p>
</ng-template>

```

Here if we have showUsers as true:
- We would go inside the div tag and using *ngFor iterate over users array.

Here if we have showUsers as false:
- We would go to the else part which is telling us to execute the ng-template with noUsers indentifier.
