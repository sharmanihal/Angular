It's a good practise to store the User Create Data Types in a seprate file to reuse in the code again.

Steps:
1. Create a <type>.model.ts file.
2. Define your interace in this model file
```
interface User{
  id:String,
  name:String
}
```
3. Import this model file where ever you want to use it inside your code.
