ngOnInit

The ngOnInit method runs after Angular has initialized all the components inputs with their initial values. A component's ngOnInit runs exactly once.

This step happens before the component's own template is initialized. This means that you can update the component's state based on its initial input values.
Why not just use Constructor instead ?

Here's a simple example that demonstrates the use of ngOnInit:

Parent Component (app.component.ts) passing an Input to the child componenent

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `<app-message [message]="'Hello from Parent!'"></app-message>`,
})
export class AppComponent {}

Child Component (message.component.ts) getting an Input from the parent component

import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-message',
  template: `<p>{{ message }}</p>`,
})
export class MessageComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() message: string = '';

  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('Message from parent:', this.message);
  }
}

In this example:

    The AppComponent (parent) passes a string value 'Hello from Parent!' to the MessageComponent using the [message] binding.
    The MessageComponent (child) receives this value through the @Input property message.
    In ngOnInit, we log the received message to the console.

When the child component is initialized, it prints the message:

Message from parent: Hello from Parent!

If you were to try accessing the @Input property message inside the constructor of the child component, the result would likely not be what you expect. Here's the modified version of the child component where we use the constructor:

Child Component (message.component.ts)

import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-message',
  template: `<p>{{ message }}</p>`,
})
export class MessageComponent {
  @Input() message: string = '';

  constructor() {
    console.log('Message from parent in constructor:', this.message);
  }
}

Explanation:

    In this version, the constructor of MessageComponent logs the value of message.
    The issue here is that at the time the constructor is called, Angular has not yet initialized the @Input properties. Therefore, the message will have its default value ('' in this case) rather than the value passed from the parent ('Hello from Parent!').

Output:

The output will be:

Message from parent in constructor: 

This is because message is still an empty string when the constructor runs.
Key Takeaway:

    Constructor is used for basic class initialization, like setting up default property values or injecting dependencies.
    ngOnInit is better suited for tasks that rely on data being fully initialized, such as accessing @Input properties. That's why in most cases, you should prefer using ngOnInit over the constructor for such logic in Angular components.
