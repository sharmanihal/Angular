### Overview of `DestroyRef`

1. **Purpose**: `DestroyRef` provides a way to register callbacks that execute when a component is destroyed. This can simplify cleanup tasks, especially when compared to managing everything within `ngOnDestroy`.

2. **Usage**:
   - You can inject `DestroyRef` into your component either via the constructor or using the `inject` function.
   - You can register multiple cleanup listeners as needed, allowing for more flexible and granular control.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Import `DestroyRef`** from `@angular/core`.
2. **Inject `DestroyRef`** into your component through the constructor or by using the `inject` function.
3. **Set up your cleanup listener** using the `onDestroy` method provided by `DestroyRef`.

### Example Implementation

Here’s how you can implement this approach in your Angular component:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit, inject, DestroyRef } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
  private destroyRef = inject(DestroyRef); // Inject DestroyRef

  ngOnInit() {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('Interval running');
    }, 1000);

    // Register a cleanup listener for component destruction
    this.destroyRef.onDestroy(() => {
      clearInterval(interval);
      console.log('Interval cleared');
    });
  }
}
```

### Benefits of Using `DestroyRef`

- **Simplified Cleanup**: You don't need to manage the lifecycle method directly if you're using this approach.
- **Multiple Listeners**: You can add as many cleanup listeners as needed within the component, providing greater flexibility.
- **Clarity**: It makes it clear where and how cleanup tasks are being managed, especially in components with multiple resources that need to be cleaned up.

### You might be getting a question , "Why are we writting the onDestroy method in ngOnInint lifecycle hook?":

**Reactive Cleanup with DestroyRef:**
When using DestroyRef, you register cleanup callb
acks during initialization. This means that as soon as the component starts, you can establish any necessary listeners or intervals. By doing so, you ensure that these resources are tied to the component's lifecycle right from the start, and you can clear them immediately when the component is destroyed.


### Why would we want to write multiple DestroyRef's :

**Separation of Concerns:**
- Clear Organization: Each cleanup callback can be dedicated to a specific resource (e.g., a database connection, an interval, an event listener). This separation makes it easier to understand what each cleanup function is responsible for, improving code readability and maintainability.
- Easier Debugging: If you need to troubleshoot why a particular resource isn’t being cleaned up, having separate callbacks can help isolate the issue more effectively.
