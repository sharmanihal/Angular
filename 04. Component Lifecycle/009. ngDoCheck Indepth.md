### **`ngDoCheck()` in Angular**
The `ngDoCheck()` lifecycle hook is used for **custom change detection** in Angular. It runs **after every change detection cycle** and allows you to detect and respond to changes that Angular‚Äôs default change detection might not catch.

---

### **When to Use `ngDoCheck()`?**
1. **Detecting Mutations in Objects or Arrays Passed via `@Input()`**
   - Angular **only detects changes when a new reference is assigned**.
   - If you **mutate** an object or array (instead of replacing it), `ngOnChanges()` **won't trigger**, but `ngDoCheck()` will.

   ```typescript
   @Component({
     selector: 'app-child',
     template: `<p>{{ data | json }}</p>`
   })
   export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges, DoCheck {
     @Input() data: any;

     ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
       console.log('ngOnChanges:', changes);
     }

     ngDoCheck() {
       console.log('ngDoCheck - Runs every change detection cycle');
     }
   }
   ```

   ```typescript
   // In Parent Component
   this.data.push('new value'); // This MUTATES the array; ngOnChanges WON‚ÄôT detect it.
   ```

---

2. **Tracking Performance-Intensive Operations**
   - If you have performance-sensitive logic that you **don‚Äôt want to run on every change detection cycle**, use `ngDoCheck()` with a **manual condition**.

   ```typescript
   ngDoCheck() {
     if (this.someExpensiveCheckNeeded) {
       console.log('Performing expensive operation');
     }
   }
   ```

---

3. **Using `KeyValueDiffers` or `IterableDiffers`**
   - These utilities help **detect changes inside objects or arrays** without replacing them.

   ```typescript
   constructor(private differs: KeyValueDiffers) {
     this.differ = this.differs.find({}).create();
   }

   ngDoCheck() {
     const changes = this.differ.diff(this.data);
     if (changes) {
       console.log('Detected changes in data:', changes);
     }
   }
   ```

### **`ngDoCheck()` vs `ngOnChanges()`**
| Feature | `ngOnChanges` | `ngDoCheck` |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Runs when `@Input()` changes? | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Runs when `@Input()` is mutated? | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Runs on every change detection cycle? | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Used for detecting deep object/array changes? | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |

---

### **When Should You Avoid `ngDoCheck()`?**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Use it cautiously** because it runs **on every change detection cycle**, which can affect performance.  
‚úÖ Instead, try:
- **Using `OnPush` change detection** to optimize performance.
- **Replacing objects/arrays instead of mutating them** so `ngOnChanges()` works.

---

### **Why Does `ngDoCheck()` Get Called Even When Using `.push()`?**
Even though `.push()` **does not trigger `ngOnChanges()`**, **`ngDoCheck()` is still called** because **Angular‚Äôs change detection runs on every event loop cycle**, regardless of whether the object reference has changed.

### **Change Detection is Triggered By External Events, Not Just Input Changes**
Angular‚Äôs change detection is triggered **whenever something asynchronous happens**, including:
1. **User events** (click, input, keypress, etc.)
2. **Async operations** (setTimeout, setInterval, HTTP calls)
3. **Component property changes**
4. **Even if nothing changed, Angular still runs the detection!**

So, when you do:
```typescript
this.items.push('New Item'); // Array reference remains the same
```
- This does **not** trigger `ngOnChanges()`, because the reference hasn't changed.
- However, if this happens inside an event handler (e.g., a button click), **Angular‚Äôs change detection cycle still runs**, and **since `ngDoCheck()` runs during every cycle, it will be called**.

---

### **Example: Push Without New Reference**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>{{ items.length }}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges, DoCheck {
  @Input() items: string[];

  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
    console.log('ngOnChanges:', changes);
  }

  ngDoCheck() {
    console.log('ngDoCheck - Runs even when items.push() happens');
  }
}
```

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: `
    <app-child [items]="list"></app-child>
    <button (click)="addItem()">Add Item</button>
  `
})
export class ParentComponent {
  list: string[] = ['Item 1'];

  addItem() {
    this.list.push('New Item'); // Mutating the array
  }
}
```

### **Expected Output When Clicking the Button**
```
ngDoCheck - Runs even when items.push() happens
ngDoCheck - Runs even when items.push() happens
ngDoCheck - Runs even when items.push() happens
...
```
üî• **Notice that `ngOnChanges()` does NOT get called, but `ngDoCheck()` does!** This is because Angular‚Äôs change detection runs after the button click event, regardless of reference change.

---

### **Key Takeaway**
Even though `ngDoCheck()` does **not detect changes itself**, it is **always triggered during Angular‚Äôs change detection cycle**, which happens after user interactions, async events, etc.
