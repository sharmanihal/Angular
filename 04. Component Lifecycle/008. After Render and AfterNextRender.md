## **🚀 `afterRender()` vs. `afterNextRender()` in Angular Signals**

### **🔄 `afterRender()`**
- Runs **after every change detection cycle**.
- It executes immediately after Angular completes a render.
- Useful for tasks that need to happen on every re-render (like UI updates, animations, etc.).

✔ **Example: Runs After Every Change Detection Cycle**
```typescript
import { afterRender } from '@angular/core';

afterRender(() => {
  console.log("This runs after every change detection cycle!");
});
```
✅ This logs **every time** Angular updates the view.

---

### **🕘 `afterNextRender()`**
- Runs **only once** after the **first** change detection cycle completes.
- Even if more change detection cycles happen later, it **does not run again**.
- Useful for actions that should happen only once after the first render (e.g., initializing a library, focusing an input field).

✔ **Example: Runs Only Once After the First Change Detection**
```typescript
import { afterNextRender } from '@angular/core';

afterNextRender(() => {
  console.log("This runs only once after the first change detection cycle!");
});
```
✅ This logs **only once**, right after the first cycle is done.

## **📌 Summary Table**
| Function | Runs Every Change Detection Cycle? | Runs Only Once After First Render? |
|----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **`afterRender()`** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **`afterNextRender()`** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

---

## **🔹 When to Use Them?**
| Use Case | Use |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Running logic on every render | `afterRender()` |
| Running logic once after first render | `afterNextRender()` |

---

### **🚀 Final Answer**
✔ **`afterRender()` runs after every change detection cycle.**  
✔ **`afterNextRender()` runs only once after the first change detection cycle.**
