1. **`afterRender`**:
   - Runs **every single time** after each change detection cycle completes.
   - Useful if you need something to respond continuously to any changes across the app.

2. **`afterNextRender`**:
   - Runs **only once** after the next change detection cycle ends, then **stops** listening.
   - Ideal for one-time actions you want to happen just once after the upcoming change, without any repeated executions.
  
   - So let's say you want to add some listener only after the first render is complete , you can set it up in afterNextRender, as it will run only once after the (first) change detecton cycle end.
   - We can register this afterNextRender again if we want, like :
  
```
export class DemoComponent {
  onButtonClick() {
    // This will re-register afterNextRender each time the button is clicked.
    afterNextRender(() => {
      console.log('Running after the next change detection cycle!');
    });

    // This could be some change to trigger change detection.
    // For example, updating a property that affects the template.
  }
}
```
This will make sure afterNextRender runs after each button click and when the next change detection cycle runs.
So, `afterRender` acts like a continuous observer of changes, while `afterNextRender` is a one-time trigger that runs once after the very next change detection cycle.
