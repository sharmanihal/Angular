### Using the `effect` Function

The `effect` function allows you to create reactive side effects in your component. Here’s how it works:

1. **Setting Up the Effect**:
   - You can wrap your signal reading logic inside the `effect` function. This will allow Angular to set up a subscription that reacts to changes in the signal.

   ```typescript
   import { effect } from '@angular/core';

   export class ServerStatusComponent {
     currentStatus = signal<'offline' | 'online' | 'unknown'>('offline');

     constructor() {
       // This will log changes to currentStatus whenever it updates
       effect(() => {
         console.log(this.currentStatus());
       });
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - When the component is destroyed, Angular automatically cleans up the subscription created by the `effect`, preventing memory leaks.

3. **Behavior**:
   - By using the `effect` function, any time `currentStatus` changes, the code within the `effect` will execute, logging the new status to the console. You will see logs for every change (like `offline`, `online`, or `unknown`).

### Why Use the `effect` Function?

- **Reactive Behavior**: It allows you to respond dynamically to changes in your signals.
- **Avoiding Manual Subscriptions**: Instead of managing subscriptions manually, you leverage Angular’s built-in functionality, which makes your code cleaner and less error-prone.
- **Use Cases**: This is useful when you want to perform side effects (like logging, triggering other actions, etc.) whenever a signal changes.


### Signal Effects Cleanup Functions

When working with Signal effects, you sometimes might need to perform some cleanup work before the effect function runs again (e.g., to clear some timer or something like that).

Angular's effect() allows you to do that!

It does provide you with an onCleanup hook which you can execute as part of your effect function to define what should happen before the effect code runs the next time:
```typescript
    effect((onCleanup) => {
      const tasks = getTasks();
      const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(`Current number of tasks: ${tasks().length}`);
      }, 1000);
      onCleanup(() => {
        clearTimeout(timer);
      });
    });
```

### Conclusion

While the `effect` function is not a traditional lifecycle hook, it is an essential part of managing state in Angular applications that use signals. It provides a way to reactively respond to changes, maintaining a clean and efficient codebase. Understanding how to use signals and the `effect` function will significantly enhance your ability to build responsive Angular applications.
