### Using the `effect` Function

The `effect` function allows you to create reactive side effects in your component. Here’s how it works:

1. **Setting Up the Effect**:
   - You can wrap your signal reading logic inside the `effect` function. This will allow Angular to set up a subscription that reacts to changes in the signal.

   ```typescript
   import { effect } from '@angular/core';

   export class ServerStatusComponent {
     currentStatus = signal<'offline' | 'online' | 'unknown'>('offline');

     constructor() {
       // This will log changes to currentStatus whenever it updates
       effect(() => {
         console.log(this.currentStatus());
       });
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - When the component is destroyed, Angular automatically cleans up the subscription created by the `effect`, preventing memory leaks.

3. **Behavior**:
   - By using the `effect` function, any time `currentStatus` changes, the code within the `effect` will execute, logging the new status to the console. You will see logs for every change (like `offline`, `online`, or `unknown`).

### Why Use the `effect` Function?

- **Reactive Behavior**: It allows you to respond dynamically to changes in your signals.
- **Avoiding Manual Subscriptions**: Instead of managing subscriptions manually, you leverage Angular’s built-in functionality, which makes your code cleaner and less error-prone.
- **Use Cases**: This is useful when you want to perform side effects (like logging, triggering other actions, etc.) whenever a signal changes.

### Conclusion

While the `effect` function is not a traditional lifecycle hook, it is an essential part of managing state in Angular applications that use signals. It provides a way to reactively respond to changes, maintaining a clean and efficient codebase. Understanding how to use signals and the `effect` function will significantly enhance your ability to build responsive Angular applications.
