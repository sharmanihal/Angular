## NgSubmit Event : 
To handle form submission in Angular, ensure that the form submission is managed by the Angular component rather than letting the browser attempt a default submission. Hereâ€™s a summarized step-by-step process to achieve this:

**1. Preventing the Default Form Submission:**
- By default, when a user clicks a submit button inside a form, the browser tries to send a request to the server.
- In Angular, importing the FormsModule already prevents this default behavior. It includes an Angular feature that takes control of the form and prevents the automatic request.
- Thus, you don't have to manually add event.preventDefault(); Angular's FormsModule does this behind the scenes.

**2. Listening to the ngSubmit Event:**
- To execute custom logic when the form is submitted, Angular provides an ngSubmit event.
- This event allows you to run your own code when the user submits the form, making it possible to handle the entered data, validate it, and update the state.

**3. Binding the ngSubmit Event:**

In new-task.component.html, bind the form's ngSubmit event to a method like onSubmit:

```html
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="enteredTitle" placeholder="Enter task title" />
    <textarea [(ngModel)]="enteredSummary" placeholder="Enter summary"></textarea>
    <input type="date" [(ngModel)]="enteredDate" />
    <button type="submit">Add Task</button>
    <button type="button" (click)="onCancel()">Cancel</button>
</form>
```
The ngSubmit event listens for the form submission, and onSubmit() will be called instead of the default browser behavior.

**4. Implementing the onSubmit Method:**
Define the onSubmit method in new-task.component.ts to handle the form data:


```typescript
export class NewTaskComponent {
    enteredTitle: string = '';
    enteredSummary: string = '';
    enteredDate: string = '';

    @Output() taskAdded = new EventEmitter<{ title: string, summary: string, date: string }>();

    onSubmit() {
        const newTask = {
            title: this.enteredTitle,
            summary: this.enteredSummary,
            date: this.enteredDate
        };

        this.taskAdded.emit(newTask);//logic to add the task to the tasks array
        this.onCancel(); // Close the dialog
    }

    onCancel() {
        // Reset fields or handle any cancellation logic
    }
}
```
**What Happens Here:**

- onSubmit() creates a new task object with the entered data.
- It uses EventEmitter to emit an event (taskAdded) to notify the parent component (e.g., tasks.component) that a new task is available.
- onCancel() is called to close the dialog or reset the form inputs.


**4. Handling the New Task in the Parent Component:**

In tasks.component.html, listen to the taskAdded event from the new-task component:

```html
<app-new-task (taskAdded)="onTaskAdded($event)"></app-new-task>
```
Define the onTaskAdded method in tasks.component.ts to add the new task to an array:

```typescript
export class TasksComponent {
    tasks: { title: string, summary: string, date: string }[] = [];

    onTaskAdded(task: { title: string, summary: string, date: string }) {
        this.tasks.push(task);
    }
}
```
The onTaskAdded method receives the emitted task object and adds it to the tasks array.
