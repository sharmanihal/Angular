**Managing and Changing State Value:**

Combining event handling with dynamic content updates is a powerful way to create interactive applications in Angular. 

Instead of a console log trigger based on the event, we can make changes to the UI by changing the value of state in this case (selectedUser state).

```
onSelectUser(){
    this.selectedUser = DUMMY_USERS[Math.floor(Math.random()*DUMMY_USERS.length)];
  }
```

**Angular State and Change Detection**:

1. State Management: Data stored in properties of a component, known as the state, impacts the UI when changed.
   
2. Change Detection: Angular automatically detects data changes and updates the UI accordingly.
   
3. Zone.js: Angular uses a library called zone.js to listen for user events and other triggers (like timers). When an event occurs, zone.js checks for changes in the Angular application.
   
4. Automatic UI Updates: Thanks to zone.js, Angular can automatically update the UI without additional work from the developer. This creates a seamless experience where changing a property value in the component class reflects immediately in the UI.

This mechanism allows Angular to efficiently manage and update the user interface based on the application’s state.

1. How Does Zone.js Work?

    Zone.js creates a "zone" that wraps around your code and monitors the lifecycle of asynchronous operations.
    When an asynchronous task starts (like an HTTP request or a setTimeout), Zone.js takes note of it.
    When the task ends, Zone.js informs Angular that the task has completed, which triggers change detection.

Here’s a high-level flow:

    Step 1: You have a button that fetches user data when clicked.
    Step 2: Angular handles the button click and makes an HTTP request.
    Step 3: Zone.js keeps track of this HTTP request, waiting for it to complete.
    Step 4: When the HTTP request finishes and the data is returned, Zone.js tells Angular that something might have changed.
    Step 5: Angular then runs change detection to see if the UI needs to be updated with the new data.

This process ensures that the UI is always up-to-date without the developer having to manually notify Angular of changes.
4. Zone.js in Action: Wrapping Async Code

    Zone.js effectively wraps all asynchronous APIs in JavaScript, including:
        setTimeout and setInterval
        HTTP requests (like those using fetch or XHR)
        Event listeners (e.g., click events)
        Promises and other asynchronous operations
    By wrapping these APIs, Zone.js creates an execution context and keeps track of when these async operations start and complete.
