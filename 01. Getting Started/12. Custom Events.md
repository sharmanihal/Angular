**@Output:**

@Output is a decorator in Angular that allows a child component to send data to its parent component. 
It marks a property in the child component as an output property, which can emit events.
This is typically used to create custom events that the parent component can listen to.

**Create an Output Event Emitter in the Child Component (user.component.ts):**
1. Import EventEmitter and Output from @angular/core.
2. Define an @Output property with an EventEmitter.
3. Emit the user ID using the emit function on the EventEmitter. 

```
@Output() select = new EventEmitter();
  onSelectUser(){
    this.select.emit(this.id);
  }
```

**Event Bind the event emitted from the Child Component in the Parent Component (app.component.ts):**
1. Bind to the custom event emitted by the child component.
2. Handle the event and log the user ID.

**HTML file code:**

```
<app-user
        [id]="users[0].id"
        [avatar]="users[0].avatar"
        [name]="users[0].name"
        (select)="onSelectUser($event)" />
```
**ts file code:**

```
onSelectUser(id:String){
    console.log('User selected:',id);
  }
```
