To improve the styling of components and follow best practices, we can use an Angular wrapper component to centralize styles, instead of duplicating styles across different components.


**1. Using a Wrapper Component:**
- Instead of duplicating CSS styles (e.g., for rounded corners and drop shadows) across multiple components, we can create a reusable wrapper component.
- This component can be placed in a shared or ui folder, indicating that it’s not tied to any specific feature but can be reused across the app.

**2. Creating the Card Component:**
Use Angular CLI to create the CardComponent inside a shared folder:
```
ng generate component shared/card --skip-tests
```
This creates the necessary files (card.component.ts, card.component.html, card.component.css) in the shared folder.

**3. Moving Styles to the Card Component:**

- Transfer the desired styles (e.g., border-radius, drop-shadow) from the specific component’s CSS file (e.g., user.component.css) to card.component.css.
- In the card.component.html, create a simple div that will act as a styled wrapper.

**4. Warp whereever you need this style:**
```
<app-card>
    <div>
        <button></button>
    </div> <!-- This is an example of wrapped content -->
</app-card>
```


**5. Preserving Wrapped Content with ng-content:**
- By default, when using a custom component like app-card, any wrapped content (e.g., the button or article) will be replaced by the app-card template.
- To preserve the wrapped content inside the CardComponent, use Angular’s ng-content in the card.component.html:

```
<div class="card">
    <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>
```
ng-content acts as a placeholder, allowing any content wrapped by app-card to be displayed inside the div.
