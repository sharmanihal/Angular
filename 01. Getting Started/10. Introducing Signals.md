**Traditional State Management:**

Angular uses Zone.js to monitor UI events, such as button clicks, which might trigger state changes.
When an event occurs, Angular checks if any data has changed in the affected zones and if so, updates the UI. This method is efficient but can be improved.

**Signals:**

Signals are special values that notify Angular when they change, triggering automatic UI updates for the parts that rely on those values.
Signals improve efficiency because they allow Angular to eliminate the need for Zone.js and perform more fine-grained change detection.
Signals are defined using the Signal function from Angular core and can be updated using the set method. 
They must be called as functions to read their current value.

**Computed Values:**

Signals also allow the creation of computed values using the computed function. 
Angular automatically tracks and updates these computed values only when the underlying Signals they depend on change.
