By implementing the `OnInit` interface in Angular, you add a layer of type safety that can help catch errors early on, such as typos in lifecycle hook names. Here's an example of how this looks:

### Example of Using `OnInit` with Interface Implementation

**Child Component (`message.component.ts`)**
```typescript
import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-message',
  template: `<p>{{ message }}</p>`,
})
export class MessageComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() message: string = '';

  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('Message from parent in ngOnInit:', this.message);
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Implementing `OnInit` Interface**: The class `MessageComponent` implements the `OnInit` interface, which is imported from `@angular/core`.
- **Ensures Proper Method Name**: By implementing `OnInit`, you ensure that Angular's `ngOnInit()` method is correctly defined. If you have a typo, TypeScript will throw an error.
- **Error Example**: If you write `ngonInit` (with a lowercase "o") and try to run this, TypeScript will produce an error:
  ```
  Property 'ngOnInit' is missing in type 'MessageComponent' but required in type 'OnInit'.
  ```
  This error guides you to fix the typo.

### Output:
- With the correct implementation, when the `ngOnInit()` method runs, it logs the `message` from the parent, such as:
  ```
  Message from parent in ngOnInit: Hello from Parent!
  ```
- If there's a typo in `ngOnInit`, you'll catch it during development rather than running into silent issues.

### Key Benefits:
- **Type Safety**: By implementing the `OnInit` interface, you ensure your lifecycle methods have the right names, reducing the risk of errors due to typos.
- **Better Developer Experience**: Itâ€™s easier to maintain and debug, especially in larger applications, as TypeScript will notify you of any inconsistencies.

This practice helps align with Angular's best practices, making your code more robust and easier to maintain.
