Let’s simplify it even further and break down why you might use an Angular selector as an attribute or class with examples.

### 1. **Using an Attribute Selector**
   - **When to Use**: Think of it like adding extra functionality or behavior to an existing HTML element. You’re saying, "This button is special; it has some extra functionality or styling."
   - **Why**: You don’t want to create a whole new element; you just want to give some extra powers to an element that already exists.

   **Example**: 
   Suppose you have a button:
   ```html
   <button>Click Me</button>
   ```
   If you want to add some custom behavior (like changing color when clicked) to all buttons without changing each button manually, you can create an attribute selector:
   ```typescript
   @Component({
     selector: '[appHighlight]',
     template: `<ng-content></ng-content>`,
     styles: [`:host { background-color: yellow; }`]
   })
   export class HighlightDirective {}
   ```
   **Usage**:
   ```html
   <button appHighlight>Click Me</button>
   ```
   **Explanation**: Here, `appHighlight` is applied as an attribute, and it makes any button look highlighted (yellow background). You didn’t need a new element—just enhanced an existing one.

### 2. **Using a Class Selector**
   - **When to Use**: This is like applying a predefined set of styles or behaviors to any element that you want. Think of it as dressing elements in a uniform.
   - **Why**: You want multiple elements to look or behave the same way, but you don’t need to create a custom element for each one.

   **Example**: 
   Suppose you want to give a certain style to multiple divs:
   ```html
   <div class="app-box">Box 1</div>
   <div class="app-box">Box 2</div>
   ```
   If you want both boxes to have a border and some padding, you can create a class selector:
   ```typescript
   @Component({
     selector: '.app-box',
     template: `<ng-content></ng-content>`,
     styles: [`:host { border: 2px solid blue; padding: 10px; }`]
   })
   export class BoxComponent {}
   ```
   **Usage**:
   ```html
   <div class="app-box">Box 1</div>
   <div class="app-box">Box 2</div>
   ```
   **Explanation**: Here, `app-box` is applied as a class, giving all divs with this class a blue border and padding. It’s a way to style multiple elements similarly without defining each one separately.

### Summary of the Differences:
- **Attribute Selector**: Adds behavior or styling to an existing element (e.g., making a button special). It’s like putting a sticker on a product to show it’s on sale.
- **Class Selector**: Applies the same behavior or style to any element with a specific class (e.g., styling multiple boxes the same way). It’s like giving all employees the same uniform to wear.

I hope this makes it clearer! Let me know if you have any more questions.
