### Understanding `ViewEncapsulation.None`

1. **What Is `ViewEncapsulation.None`?**
   - By default, Angular applies *view encapsulation* to keep the styles defined in a component’s CSS file scoped to that specific component.
   - Angular does this by adding unique attributes to the host element and the styles, making sure the styles only affect the HTML elements inside the component.
   - `ViewEncapsulation.None` turns off this encapsulation, making the component’s styles *global*. This means that any CSS you write in that component’s CSS file can apply to any matching elements across the entire application, not just within the component’s template.

2. **Behavior with `ViewEncapsulation.None`**:
   - With `ViewEncapsulation.None`, a class like `.dashboard-item` written in `dashboard-item.component.css` will apply to *any* element in the entire app that has the class `dashboard-item`.
   - Similarly, styles like `.dashboard-item header` will target any `header` element that is inside an element with the `dashboard-item` class, no matter where it exists in the DOM.
   - This global behavior can be useful if you want consistent styles across your app, but it can also lead to unintended style clashes.

### Why Styles Don’t Apply without `ViewEncapsulation.None`

1. **Local Encapsulation by Default**:
   - Without setting `ViewEncapsulation` to `None`, Angular uses encapsulation mechanisms like `Emulated` (the default), which scopes styles to the component’s template.
   - Even if you add a class like `dashboard-item` to the host element (`<app-dashboard-item>`) using the `host: { class: "dashboard-item" }` property, the styles in `dashboard-item.component.css` are still scoped to *inside* the component’s template, not to the `app-dashboard-item` host element.

2. **The Problem of Styling the Host Element**:
   - When you add a class using the `host` property, it indeed adds the class to the host element (`<app-dashboard-item>`). However, because of view encapsulation, Angular's CSS scoping mechanism looks for the `dashboard-item` class *inside* the component’s template, not on the host element itself.
   - This means styles like `.dashboard-item header` will not apply because Angular is looking for `.dashboard-item` within the component’s template, not on the host element, even though that class exists on the host element itself.

3. **Using `:host` to Solve This**:
   - To directly style the host element from within a component's CSS, you use the `:host` selector. For example:
     ```css
     :host {
       /* styles that apply to <app-dashboard-item> */
       display: block;
       padding: 1rem;
     }

     :host header {
       /* styles that apply to <header> inside <app-dashboard-item> */
       font-weight: bold;
     }
     ```
   - By using `:host`, you tell Angular explicitly that you want to apply styles to the component’s host element (`<app-dashboard-item>`) even when encapsulation is in place.

### Summary of the Approaches

- **Without ViewEncapsulation.None**:
   - Styles are scoped locally to the component. Use `:host` to style the host element directly.
   - Using the `host` property to add classes to the host element will not automatically apply styles if those styles are defined in a component’s CSS file without `:host`.

- **With ViewEncapsulation.None**:
   - Styles become global, affecting any matching elements across the app.
   - Using the `host` property to add classes works because the styles are no longer scoped to the component’s template.

### Practical Implications

- Use `ViewEncapsulation.None` if you want a component’s styles to be global.
- Use the `:host` selector when you want to style the host element of a component without turning off encapsulation.
- For most cases, it’s good practice to keep encapsulation enabled (i.e., use the default `Emulated` mode) to prevent unintended style conflicts, unless you have a specific reason to make styles global.

This understanding of Angular's encapsulation system allows you to choose the right strategy for styling your components based on the level of scoping you need.


### Note : 
When ViewEncapsulation is set to None, the :host selector becomes ineffective because styles are treated as global. The scoping provided by :host only applies when styles are encapsulated within the component's template. With None, the styles are no longer bound to that particular component's structure, making :host lose its specificity and purpose. Instead, all styles behave as if they were defined in a global stylesheet.
