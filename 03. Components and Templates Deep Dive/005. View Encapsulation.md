**style encapsulation** in Angular and how it affects styling of projected content through **Content Projection**. Let’s break down the key concepts and the solution:

### What’s the Problem Here?
- You have a `control` component with a CSS rule that is supposed to style `input` and `textarea` elements inside an element with the class `control`.
- The `control` component uses **content projection** (`<ng-content>`), so you expect the `input` and `textarea` elements to be styled when they are projected into this component.
- However, the styles are not being applied as expected.

### Why Aren’t the Styles Applied?
- **Component Style Encapsulation**: By default, Angular uses **emulated view encapsulation**. This means that styles defined in a component are scoped only to that component, making them behave like they are part of a custom Shadow DOM.
- In your `control` component, Angular sees only the `<ng-content>` placeholder initially, not the `input` and `textarea` that will eventually be projected. So the styles targeting elements inside the `control` class do not apply to the projected content.

### What is View Encapsulation?
- **Emulated** (Default): Angular emulates the behavior of Shadow DOM, scoping styles to the component. This means styles don't leak out to other components and won’t affect elements projected into the component.
- **None**: Disables Angular's style encapsulation, making styles global. This means styles from the `control` component can apply to elements outside of it, including projected content.
- **ShadowDom**: Uses the native Shadow DOM feature, providing the same encapsulation behavior as Emulated but using the actual browser’s Shadow DOM.

### How to Fix the Issue?
To make the styles from your `control` component apply to the projected `input` and `textarea`, you need to disable the style encapsulation. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Modify the Component**:
   In your `control` component, add the `encapsulation` property to disable style encapsulation:
   ```typescript
   import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-control',
     templateUrl: './control.component.html',
     styleUrls: ['./control.component.css'],
     encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None  // Disable encapsulation
   })
   export class ControlComponent {}
   ```
   By setting `ViewEncapsulation.None`, the styles defined in `control.component.css` become global, so they can style the `input` and `textarea` that are projected into the component.

2. **Impact of This Change**:
   - The styles in `control.component.css` can now affect the projected content because they are no longer scoped to the `control` component.
   - This means the `input` and `textarea` elements, even though they are projected using `<ng-content>`, will be styled as intended.

3. **When to Use This**:
   - Disabling encapsulation is rare, but it’s useful when you need component styles to apply globally or to projected content.
   - Use it when you need more control over styling or when the default encapsulation prevents certain styles from being applied as expected.

### Example
Here’s a simple scenario demonstrating how this works:

**Control Component (HTML)**:
```html
<div class="control">
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>
```

**Control Component (CSS)**:
```css
.control label {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: blue;
}

.control input,
.control textarea {
  border: 2px solid red;
  padding: 8px;
}
```

**Parent Component (HTML)**:
```html
<app-control>
  <label>Username</label>
  <input type="text">
  <textarea></textarea>
</app-control>
```

**With `ViewEncapsulation.None`**, the styles defined in `control.component.css` will apply to the `label`, `input`, and `textarea` elements that are projected into the `app-control` component.

### Summary
- **Encapsulation** is a way to scope styles to components, but in some cases, you might need to disable it to apply styles to content projected into the component.
- **ViewEncapsulation.None** makes component styles global, which is useful when working with content projection where styles need to apply to the projected content.
- Use this feature sparingly, as it can lead to styling conflicts if not managed carefully.

This solution ensures your inputs and text areas look as intended within the `control` component.
