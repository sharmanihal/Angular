### Key Concepts Recap

1. **Every Angular Component Has a Host Element**:
   - The host element is the DOM element that Angular inserts into your HTML to render a component.
   - For example, if you have a component with the selector `app-control`, when Angular renders it, you'll see an `<app-control>` tag in the DOM. This is the host element.
   - Inside this `<app-control>` tag, you might have other HTML elements like `<label>`, `<input>`, and `<ng-content>` that make up the template of the component.

2. **:host Selector**:
   - `:host` allows you to apply styles directly to the host element (e.g., `<app-control>`).
   - When you use `:host`, it targets the host element itself, but not elements inside of it directly.
   - For example:
     ```css
     :host {
       display: block;
       margin: 10px;
     }
     ```
     This CSS will style the `<app-control>` element, applying `display: block` and `margin: 10px` to it.

3. **View Encapsulation and Scoping**:
   - By default, Angular uses `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated`, meaning styles in a component’s CSS file are scoped to that component.
   - This means the styles are encapsulated and won't "leak" outside the component.
   - If you set `encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None`, Angular stops scoping the styles, making them global (similar to putting them in a global `styles.css` file).

4. **Why Styles Break with Encapsulation Set to None**:
   - When you disable view encapsulation, `:host` loses its effectiveness because the styles are no longer scoped to that specific component. They become global, and Angular treats them as if they’re targeting the whole page, not just the component.
   - In this scenario, targeting `.control` or `app-control` might work better.

### Fixing the Issue: Adding a Class

When you disabled view encapsulation and found that `:host` no longer worked as expected, you shifted to adding a class directly to the `app-control` element:

```html
<app-control class="control"></app-control>
```

This approach works because:

- **Directly Adding a Class**:
  - By adding a `control` class to the `<app-control>` element in the template where it’s used, you give it a class that can be targeted by any styles looking for `.control`.
  - Even with view encapsulation disabled, styles defined for `.control` can now apply to elements inside `<app-control>` like `<label>`, `<input>`, and `<textarea>`.
  - This solution works because the class is now globally applied, and any CSS rules targeting `.control` will be effective.

### Why Use This Approach?
- **When Encapsulation Is Disabled**: If you disable encapsulation for a component and still want styles to be scoped specifically to instances of that component, adding a class directly to the component’s selector can help.
- **Control Over Component Styles**: You can manually decide where and when styles apply by adding classes to component instances, giving you more control over how styles are applied in different parts of your application.

### Simplified Example

1. **Component with Encapsulation Disabled**:
   ```typescript
   import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-control',
     templateUrl: './control.component.html',
     styleUrls: ['./control.component.css'],
     encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None
   })
   export class ControlComponent {}
   ```

2. **Adding Class in the Parent Component**:
   ```html
   <!-- Parent component's template -->
   <app-control class="control"></app-control>
   ```

3. **CSS in `control.component.css`**:
   ```css
   .control label,
   .control input,
   .control textarea {
     width: 100%;
     padding: 0.5rem;
     border: 1px solid #ccc;
     border-radius: 4px;
     font: inherit;
     font-size: 0.9rem;
     color: #4f4b53;
   }
   ```

By adding the `control` class directly in the parent component's template, you ensure that the styles will apply correctly, even with view encapsulation set to `None`. This approach ensures that your component has the intended styles while allowing you to manage how the class is applied.

### Summary

- Use `:host` when you need to target the component’s own host element and the default view encapsulation is active.
- If encapsulation is set to `None`, `:host` loses its scoping, and you should use global class-based styles.
- Adding a class directly to the component's host element can help maintain specific styles, even when encapsulation is disabled.
  
This understanding helps you balance the benefits of Angular's encapsulation with the flexibility of global styles when needed!
