1. **Host Property in `@Component` Decorator**:
   - This is the preferred way to add properties or event bindings to the host element.
   - It keeps all host-related bindings in one place, making it easier to read and maintain.
   - Example for class binding:
     ```typescript
     @Component({
       selector: 'app-control',
       host: {
         '[class]': 'control',
         '(click)': 'onClick()'
       }
     })
     ```

2. **`@HostBinding` Decorator**:
   - Used to bind properties or attributes directly to the host element from within the component class.
   - It's particularly useful for dynamic properties or when the property name differs from the attribute.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     @HostBinding('class') control = 'control-class';
     ```
   - This approach is not as favored today since it can make the class definition more complex.

3. **`@HostListener` Decorator**:
   - Allows you to listen to events on the host element and execute a method when the event occurs.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     @HostListener('click') onClick() {
       console.log('Clicked!');
     }
     ```
   - Provides a cleaner alternative to specifying event bindings directly in the `host` property, especially for more complex event logic.

4. **View Encapsulation Impact**:
   - With `ViewEncapsulation.None`, styles are applied globally, and the `:host` selector becomes ineffective since the styles are no longer scoped to the component.
   - For encapsulated components, using `:host` allows targeting the host element while keeping the styles scoped to the component's template.

Both methods (`@HostBinding`/`@HostListener` vs. `host` property in `@Component`) have their uses, but it's generally good practice to use the `host` property in the `@Component` decorator for simple bindings and events, as recommended by the Angular team. However, `@HostListener` can be preferred when the logic tied to an event is more involved or when it's more natural to have the logic alongside related methods.
