To render the component associated with a specific route in Angular, we need to specify *where* it should appear in the application’s UI. Here’s a breakdown of how to set this up:

1. **Define the Route**:  
   In this example, a route has been created for `/tasks`, which specifies that `TasksComponent` should load when the user navigates to `/tasks` (e.g., `localhost:4200/tasks` during development). However, simply defining this route doesn't render the component just yet.

2. **Using `RouterOutlet` as a Placeholder**:
   - By default, Angular does not automatically replace the entire screen with the component associated with a route. This approach is intentional so that static elements (like a header or footer) stay in place across different routes.
   - To specify where routed components should appear, add a `RouterOutlet` directive in the main template, usually inside the `AppComponent` template (typically `app.component.html`).
   - `RouterOutlet` serves as a placeholder for Angular, marking the exact location where the component associated with the current route will load.

3. **Set Up `RouterOutlet` in the Template**:
   - Replace any placeholder content (like a to-do paragraph) in your `AppComponent` template with `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`.
   - This directive tells Angular where to insert the content of the component associated with the active route.

4. **Import `RouterOutlet`**:
   - Import `RouterOutlet` into the component’s TypeScript file, adding it to the `imports` array within the component’s decorator if using standalone components, to ensure Angular recognizes and can render it.

5. **Testing the Route**:
   - Once set up, visiting `/tasks` should now render the `TasksComponent` content inside the `RouterOutlet` placeholder.
   - You’ll see that the static elements (like a header) remain unchanged, and only the content within `RouterOutlet` updates based on the active route.

## Multiple Routes
With this setup, routing in Angular can now be customized further by adding multiple routes and components, all while reusing common elements across different views. This makes the app more modular and navigable without losing essential UI components like headers or footers.

We can also have multiple routes , and based on the route we are on this ```<router-outlet/>``` renders the component.

**In this case:**

1. If we are in localhost:4200 path , NoTaskComponent gets rendered
2. If we are in localhost:4200/tasks path, TasksComponent gets rendered.
