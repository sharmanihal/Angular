These input names should be same as what we give in the resolve and data object of our route below(Second Pic)

# Automatic Re-fetching on Parameter Changes:

- A resolver will automatically re-execute if route parameters change (e.g., switching from user userId: 1 to userId: 2). This makes it especially convenient for scenarios where dynamic data depends on URL parameters.

Ensures Data Availability Before Component Initialization:

- With a resolver, the component only initializes after the data is available, preventing incomplete views or errors due to missing data.
- This approach is useful when the component’s functionality depends on the data, making sure everything is loaded in advance.

## There is another way to capture this dynamic data using ActivatedRoute.

The alternative approach you're describing—using the `ActivatedRoute` directly to access both static and dynamic route data—is a perfectly valid way to fetch route data. Here’s a breakdown of the key points:

### Using `ActivatedRoute`'s `data` Property
- **When to use**: This approach is useful when you need access to both static and dynamic data at once, and you prefer using observables and subscriptions in your component to handle updates.
  
- **How it works**:
  - The `ActivatedRoute`'s `data` property is an observable that emits a merged object of static and dynamic data.
  - **Static data** is provided through the `data` property of the route configuration (like the `message: 'Hello!'`).
  - **Dynamic data** comes from resolvers or other dynamic sources that are linked to the route, such as the username fetched based on route parameters.

- **Example**:
  You can inject the `ActivatedRoute` into your component and then subscribe to the `data` observable, which will provide both types of data. You can handle the changes dynamically by subscribing to it. This is great for cases where your component needs to react to changes in route data.

```typescript
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-tasks',
  templateUrl: './user-tasks.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./user-tasks.component.css']
})
export class UserTasksComponent implements OnInit {
  message: string;
  username: string;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    // Subscribe to the data observable from the ActivatedRoute
    this.route.data.subscribe((data) => {
      console.log(data); // Logs an object containing both static and dynamic data
      this.message = data.message;  // Static data
      this.username = data.username;  // Dynamic data from the resolver
    });
  }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Observables**: Since `data` is an observable, it provides the flexibility to handle asynchronous data and automatically emits changes if the route changes (e.g., when parameters change and the route is reactivated).
