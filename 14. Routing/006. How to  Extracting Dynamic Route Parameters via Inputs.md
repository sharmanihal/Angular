### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Define the Route with a Dynamic Parameter:**
   In the routing configuration, set up a route with a dynamic path segment, e.g., `/tasks/:userId`.
   ```typescript
   const routes: Routes = [
     { path: 'tasks/:userId', component: UserTasksComponent },
     { path: '', component: NoTaskComponent }
   ];
   ```
   
2. **Enable Component Input Binding in `provideRouter`:**
   Tell Angular that you want to use the input binding method by enabling `withComponentInputBinding`. This function will ensure that any matching route parameter is directly assigned to the corresponding input in the component.

4. **Add a Required Input in the Component to Capture `userId`:**
   In your `UserTasksComponent`, define an `input` sinalproperty that will hold the route parameter value. **The property name should match the route parameter name (`userId` in this case).**

5. **Fetch Data Based on `userId`:**
   Use the `userId` input in the component to retrieve the appropriate user data. This is typically done by injecting a service that provides the user information.

6. **Display the User Name in the Template:**
   Bind the computed property in the component's template to display the user name:
   ```html
   <div>
     Selected User: {{ userName() }}
   </div>
   ```

### Explanation of Key Parts

- input(): Angular assigns userId directly from the route parameter due to withComponentInputBinding.
- Using the Service: Inject UsersService to fetch user data. You could alternatively call an API in a real application.
- Computed Property with Signals: Since Angular is handling reactive states, computed() dynamically updates userName if userId changes.
