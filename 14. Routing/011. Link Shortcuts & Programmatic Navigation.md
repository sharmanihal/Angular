Say we want to go back one level back in the route hierarchy angular provides us a very easy way to do that:

```
<a routerLink="../" >Cancel</a>
```

This link will go back one level in the URL

Say this is the ```https://github.com/sharmanihal/Angular/``` url you are on, so now this anchor tag will take you back to ```https://github.com/sharmanihal/```


### Programmatic access to navigate URL:

Say you want to navigate to some url based on the button click , programmatically when the button is clicked.
You can do that by using the below method:

First Inject the router service provided by angular
Then use it to navigate to a url

You can also provide some more config to the navigation like in this case ```replaceUrl:true``` will make sure user is not able to press the back button and come back to the previous page, since the form is already submitted.
