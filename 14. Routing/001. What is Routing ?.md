**When a user "navigates" to a new section, the application doesn't actually load a new HTML page from the server. Instead, Angular updates the content displayed on the single existing page by loading different components based on the URL or user actions. This gives the user the experience of switching between pages, but technically, it’s just the same page dynamically changing its content.**


Routing, in the context of Angular, refers to the mechanism that allows single-page applications (SPAs) to simulate the experience of having multiple pages, even though there's technically only one HTML file. 

In SPAs, like those built with Angular, a single HTML page is served from the server, and the app loads once in the browser. To make the app feel like it has multiple pages, Angular uses routing to load different parts of the UI based on the current URL. This creates the illusion of page navigation, allowing users to switch between different "views" or "screens" without reloading the entire page. 

Routing in Angular is especially useful because:
1. **Dynamic UI updates**: It lets the UI update dynamically based on the user’s navigation actions.
2. **URL management**: Angular updates the browser’s address bar to reflect the current "page" or view, making it easier for users to share specific parts of the app.
3. **Component loading**: It allows Angular to load different components based on the URL, providing a seamless and fast user experience.

In short, routing in Angular gives users the ability to navigate through different sections of the app, maintaining the experience of a multi-page website within a single-page application.
