In this initial setup, the application currently lacks routing, so all we have is the `AppComponent`, which loads and displays content initially. To build out routing, we’ll use Angular’s routing features to dynamically change what appears on the screen based on the URL. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how to set up and manage routing in this Angular project:

1. **Enable Routing**:  
   In your `main.ts` file, pass a configuration object as a second argument to `bootstrapApplication`. This configuration will contain the routing setup, specifically by calling `provideRouter`, which Angular imports from `@angular/router`. 

2. **Define Routes**:
   - The routes are defined in an array, where each route is an object containing:
      - A **path**: The URL path (e.g., `/tasks`).
      - A **component**: The component to load when this path is active (e.g., `TasksComponent`).
   - Each route tells Angular which component to display based on the current URL.

3. **Component Activation on URL Path**:
   When a user navigates to a specific path, Angular loads the associated component for that path, updating the displayed content without reloading the page. This simulates the experience of navigating between different pages in a traditional multi-page app.

## Outsource Routing Setup:
   Since large applications often have many routes, it’s common to organize routes in a separate file. For example:
   - Create a `app.routes.ts` file to store your route definitions.
   - In `app.routes.ts`, export a constant called `routes` with type `Routes` (from Angular’s router module), containing your route array.

   - Reference this `routes` array in `main.ts` by importing it and passing it to `provideRouter`.

5. **Optional Configuration Outsourcing**:
   To keep `main.ts` clean, you could also move the configuration object to another file, say `app.config.ts`, where you would define and export an `appConfig` object of type `ApplicationConfig`. Then, import `appConfig` into `main.ts` and use it to initialize the application.

**app.config.ts**

**main.ts**

This setup provides Angular with the necessary configuration to enable routing and create a clear file structure. Once routing is active, you can start adding more routes to manage your application’s navigation structure.
