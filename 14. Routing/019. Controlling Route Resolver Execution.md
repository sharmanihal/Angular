### Issue: Query Parameters Not Triggering Resolver
In the default behavior of Angular routing, **resolvers** are executed when **route parameters** change (e.g., `/user/:id`). However, **query parameters** (e.g., `/user/:id?sort=desc`) do not automatically trigger a resolver update, even if the values in the query parameters change. This is the issue you faced in the application, where the tasks weren’t updated when query parameters changed.

### Solution: Using `runGuardsAndResolvers`
To fix this issue, Angular provides a `runGuardsAndResolvers` property in the route configuration, which controls when resolvers and guards should be re-executed. By default, resolvers are re-executed only when **route parameters** change, not query parameters.

There are a few options for the `runGuardsAndResolvers` property:
- **`'always'`**: This will trigger the resolver function every time the route is activated, regardless of any parameter changes. It ensures that data is always re-fetched whenever the route is navigated to, which might be more costly but guarantees the freshest data.
- **`'paramsOrQueryParamsChange'`**: This option is more specific and ensures that resolvers are triggered only when **either route parameters or query parameters change**. This is typically what you'd want in scenarios like yours, where the query parameters (e.g., sorting/filtering) should affect the data being loaded.

### Example: Setting `runGuardsAndResolvers` to `paramsOrQueryParamsChange`

Here’s how you can set up the route configuration to ensure the resolver is called when either the route parameters or query parameters change:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'user/:userId',
    component: UserTasksComponent,
    resolve: {
      username: resolveUserName,
      tasks: resolveUserTasks
    },
    runGuardsAndResolvers: 'paramsOrQueryParamsChange',  // Ensures resolver is triggered on query param change
  }
];
```

### How It Works:
1. **Route Parameters Change**: The resolver is re-executed because Angular detects a change in the route path (e.g., `/user/1` to `/user/2`).
2. **Query Parameters Change**: With the setting `runGuardsAndResolvers: 'paramsOrQueryParamsChange'`, Angular will now also re-execute the resolver when query parameters change (e.g., `/user/1?sort=desc` to `/user/1?sort=asc`).
3. **Data Update**: When query parameters change, your resolver function will fetch the updated data (e.g., sorted tasks) and pass it to the component, allowing it to update.

### Benefits:
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: By using this setup, your resolvers will react to changes in query parameters and fetch the appropriate data (tasks, sorted by query parameters in your case).
- **Cleaner Components**: You can keep your components lean and delegate data fetching to resolvers, making your component more focused on rendering the view and less on managing data fetching logic.

### Conclusion:
By using the `runGuardsAndResolvers` property, you ensure that the data required for the route, including dynamic data based on query parameters, is always up-to-date. The solution makes your routing behavior more flexible and responsive to changes, especially when dealing with query parameters, and ensures your app works as expected when navigating between users and adjusting query parameters.
