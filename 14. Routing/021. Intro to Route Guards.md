### Key Concepts of Route Guards

1. **Purpose**: 
   - Route Guards control navigation in Angular by allowing or denying access to routes based on specific conditions.
   - Useful for:
     - Authentication/Authorization checks.
     - Confirming unsaved changes before leaving a page.
     - Conditional navigation based on application logic.

2. **Types of Route Guards**:
   - **`canMatch`**: 
     - Decides whether a route should be matched based on the current URL.  
     - More modern and versatile. It's checked first, even before `canActivate`.
   - **`canActivate`**: 
     - Checked after a route is matched but before the associated component is loaded.  
     - Commonly used for authentication and permissions.
   - **`canActivateChild`**: 
     - Similar to `canActivate`, but applies to child routes specifically.
   - **`canDeactivate`**: 
     - Checked when navigating away from a route. Useful for prompting unsaved changes.
   - **`canLoad`** (legacy): 
     - Prevents lazy-loaded modules from being loaded. It's replaced by `canMatch`.

### Example: Implementing a `canMatch` Guard

Hereâ€™s a practical implementation:

#### Define the Guard Function

```typescript
import { CanMatchFn, Router, UrlSegment } from '@angular/router';

export const dummyCanMatch: CanMatchFn = (route, segments: UrlSegment[]) => {
  // Example: Grant access randomly (50% chance)
  const shouldGetAccess = Math.random() < 0.5;

  if (shouldGetAccess) {
    return true; // Allow access
  } else {
    // Deny access and redirect
    const router = inject(Router);
    return new RedirectCommand(router.parseUrl('/unauthorized')) // Redirect to "unauthorized" route
  }
};
```

#### Use the Guard in a Route

```typescript
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'user-tasks',
    component: UserTasksComponent,
    canMatch: [dummyCanMatch], // Apply the guard
  },
  {
    path: 'unauthorized',
    component: UnauthorizedComponent, // Component to handle unauthorized access
  },
];
```

### Observations

- **Redirection**:
  - Returning `false` from the guard denies access but leaves the user on a broken page (no matching route).  
  - Instead, returning a **`URLTree`** ensures the user is redirected appropriately.

- **Support for Observables**:
  - Guards can return observables or promises, making them suitable for asynchronous operations like API calls.

- **Multiple Guards**:
  - You can apply multiple guards (`canMatch`, `canActivate`, etc.) on the same route for layered control.

### When to Use Each Guard

- **`canMatch`**: To check whether the current URL matches the route before any further action. (Modern and versatile)
- **`canActivate`**: For additional checks after a route is matched but before its component loads. (Legacy but still common)
- **`canDeactivate`**: To ensure the user is aware of unsaved changes when navigating away.
- **`canActivateChild`**: For specific control over child routes.

This approach ensures fine-grained control over navigation and security in Angular applications.
