### 1. Highlighting the Active Link
To provide feedback on the currently selected user, `RouterLinkActive` is a great Angular feature. When combined with a CSS class, **it dynamically applies the class only to links that lead to the active route**. Here’s how you can set it up:

   - **Add `RouterLinkActive` to the Link**: In the template where you define your users list, add the directive to each link:
     ```html
     <a 
       [routerLink]="['/tasks', user.id]" 
       routerLinkActive="selected" 
       *ngFor="let user of users">
       {{ user.name }}
     </a>
     ```
   - **Update Imports**: Since `RouterLinkActive` is a directive, import it from `@angular/router` and add it to the `imports` array in the component decorator.

   - **Define the CSS**: The `selected` class should have styling that visually distinguishes the active link. For example:
     ```css
     .selected {
       font-weight: bold;
       color: blue;
     }
     ```

### 2. Using Dynamic Routes
Now, instead of each user link pointing to `/tasks`, let’s include the user ID in the URL. This way, each link uniquely identifies a user’s task list:

   - **Set up the Route Configuration**: In your routes array, define a path with a dynamic segment. For example:
     ```typescript
     const routes: Routes = [
       { path: 'tasks/:id', component: TasksComponent },
       { path: '', component: NoTaskComponent }
     ];
     ```
     This way, `/tasks/1` could load tasks for user with ID `1`, `/tasks/2` for user with ID `2`, and so on.

   - **Use `RouterLink` to Generate the URL Dynamically**:
     ```html
     <a 
       [routerLink]="['/tasks', user.id]" 
       routerLinkActive="selected" 
       *ngFor="let user of users">
       {{ user.name }}
     </a>
     ```
     Here, `[routerLink]="['/tasks', user.id]"` dynamically sets the path based on each `user.id`.


### 4. Verify the Active Link Highlighting
With `RouterLinkActive="selected"`, Angular automatically applies the `selected` class to the link that matches the current route, including the dynamic ID. Now, as you click on different users, only the active user’s link will be highlighted, and the page won’t reload thanks to Angular’s routing.

By following these steps, you can dynamically route to each user's task page, highlight the active user, and provide a seamless single-page navigation experience.
