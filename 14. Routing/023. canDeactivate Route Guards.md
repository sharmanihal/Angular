The **`canDeactivate`** guard in Angular is a powerful tool for controlling navigation away from a component, particularly when you want to ensure the user doesn't accidentally lose unsaved data. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

---

### **Purpose of `canDeactivate`:**
- It allows you to control whether a user is allowed to leave a component or page.
- Typically used in forms or data entry components where unsaved changes may exist.

---

### **How `canDeactivate` Works:**
1. **Guard Function or Class:**
   - Like other route guards, `canDeactivate` can be implemented either as a function (modern approach) or as a class (older but still valid).
   - The guard function or method determines whether navigation away from the route should proceed.

2. **Parameters:**
   - The `canDeactivate` guard gets access to:
     - The **component instance** being navigated away from.
     - Optionally, additional parameters about the current and next router states.

3. **Return Value:**
   - A **boolean**, an **observable**, or a **promise**:
     - `true`: Allow navigation.
     - `false`: Prevent navigation.
     - An observable or promise that resolves to `true` or `false`.

### **Example of a Function-Based `canDeactivate` Guard:**

```typescript
import { CanDeactivateFn } from '@angular/router';
import { NewTaskComponent } from './new-task.component';

export const canLeaveEditPage: CanDeactivateFn<NewTaskComponent> = (component) => {
  // Check if the user has unsaved data
  if (component.enteredTitle || component.enteredDate || component.enteredSummary) {
    // Prompt the user
    return window.confirm('Do you really want to leave? You will lose the entered data.');
  }
  return true; // Allow navigation if no unsaved data
};
```

### **Using the Guard in Routes:**

```typescript
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { NewTaskComponent } from './new-task.component';
import { canLeaveEditPage } from './can-deactivate.guard';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'new-task',
    component: NewTaskComponent,
    canDeactivate: [canLeaveEditPage], // Attach the guard
  },
];
```

---

### **How It Works in Practice:**
1. The guard function runs before Angular initiates navigation away from the route.
2. If the user has unsaved changes, a confirmation dialog (using `window.confirm`) is shown.
3. Based on the user's choice (`OK` or `Cancel`):
   - If `OK` is clicked, navigation proceeds.
   - If `Cancel` is clicked, navigation is blocked.

---

### **Why Use `canDeactivate`:**
- **Prevent Data Loss:** Protect against losing unsaved changes in forms.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provide a smooth experience by prompting the user before leaving a page with changes.
- **Custom Logic:** You can inject services, use observables, or implement more complex conditions to decide navigation.

This makes `canDeactivate` guards an essential tool for building user-friendly Angular applications where data integrity and user confirmation are priorities.
