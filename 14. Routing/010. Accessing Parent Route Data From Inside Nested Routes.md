Let's say we want to acess the URL Parameter of UserId in one of the child component of the Parent Path.

There are two ways to achieve that:

1. We can use the ActivatedRoute method and subscribe to the paramMap observable, like we saw before.
2. We can use the input signal, with the same name as that of the parameter in this case "userId"

But for the second method to work , we need to add some changes to out app.config.ts file.

We need to set this paramsInheritanceStrategy to always, using the withRouterConfig() function.

Then back in our child component code we can access the url parameter using input signal.
