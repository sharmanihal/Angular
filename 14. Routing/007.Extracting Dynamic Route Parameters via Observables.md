1. **Using `ActivatedRoute` Service for Older Versions or Alternatives**:
   - If `@Input` binding isn’t an option (or if you prefer not to use it), you can extract route parameters by injecting the `ActivatedRoute` service, which Angular provides.
   - `ActivatedRoute` contains details about the currently active route, like path parameters, and exposes them as observables.

2. **Setting Up Observables for Route Parameters**:
   - To access these parameters, you can subscribe to the `paramMap` observable from `ActivatedRoute`.
   - `paramMap` contains key-value pairs for parameters, so if your route URL has a parameter like `userId`, you can access it using `paramMap.get('userId')`.

3. **Updating Component Data Reactively**:
   - By subscribing to `paramMap`, the component will automatically update whenever the route parameter (e.g., `userId`) changes.
   - This is particularly useful because Angular reuses the same component instance when navigating between similar routes. Subscribing ensures your component data updates without recreating the entire component.

4. **Cleaning Up Subscriptions**:
   - Since you're working with observables, it’s essential to clean up subscriptions. You can use Angular’s `DestroyRef` and `ngOnDestroy` hook to unsubscribe when the component is destroyed, preventing memory leaks.
