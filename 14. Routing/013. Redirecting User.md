The `pathMatch` property in Angular’s route configuration determines how strictly the `path` should match the URL. This property has two options: `full` and `prefix`. Here’s how each one works in the context of a redirect:

- **`pathMatch: 'prefix'` with `path: 'home'`**:
  - This will match **any URL that starts with `/home`**, like:
    - `/home`
    - `/home/123`
    - `/home/abc`
    - `/home/anything-else`
  - All these URLs will trigger the route because they **start with** `/home`.

- **`pathMatch: 'full'` with `path: 'home'`**:
  - This will match **only the exact URL** `/home`.
  - It will **not** match:
    - `/home/123`
    - `/home/abc`
    - `/home/anything-else`
  - Only `/home` by itself will activate this route. 

So, **`prefix` is more flexible** and matches anything that begins with the specified path, while **`full` is strict** and only matches exact URLs.
