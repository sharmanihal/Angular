## Using Input Signal and withComponentInputBinding() enabled:
One way is to use input Signal to fetch the queryParams from the url:

If you have enables in your config, you can easily grab the query params from the url, just name the input signal as the key given in the query param

## Using ActivatedRoute:

If you don't want to use the above setup you can also setup a subscription to queryParams observable provided by ActivatedRoute.
