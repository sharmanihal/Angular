Since UserTaskComponent is a declared as the child component in the routes, angular provides us with relative routes,
where the starting of the URL will be appended with what the path of the parent is :

So here the child componenet will be appended with 'users/:userId' at the start of the URL, so that we dont have to go and write logic to fetch the userId etc from the URL.
